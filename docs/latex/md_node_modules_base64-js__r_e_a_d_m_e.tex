Many browsers already have base64 encoding/decoding functionality, but it is for text data, not all-\/purpose binary data.

Sometimes encoding/decoding binary data in the browser is useful, and that is what this module does.

\subsection*{install}

With \href{https://npmjs.org}{\tt npm} do\+:

{\ttfamily npm install base64-\/js}

\subsection*{methods}

`var base64 = require(\textquotesingle{}base64-\/js')\`{}

{\ttfamily base64} has two exposed functions, {\ttfamily to\+Byte\+Array} and {\ttfamily from\+Byte\+Array}, which both take a single argument.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily to\+Byte\+Array} -\/ Takes a base64 string and returns a byte array
\item {\ttfamily from\+Byte\+Array} -\/ Takes a byte array and returns a base64 string
\end{DoxyItemize}
