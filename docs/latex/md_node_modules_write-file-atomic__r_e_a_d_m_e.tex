This is an extension for node\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily fs.\+write\+File} that makes its operation atomic and allows you set ownership (uid/gid of the file).

Atomically and asynchronously writes data to a file, replacing the file if it already exists. data can be a string or a buffer.

The file is initially named {\ttfamily filename + \char`\"{}.\char`\"{} + murmurhex(\+\_\+\+\_\+filename, process.\+pid, ++invocations)}. If write\+File completes successfully then, if passed the {\bfseries chown} option it will change the ownership of the file. Finally it renames the file back to the filename you specified. If it encounters errors at any of these steps it will attempt to unlink the temporary file and then pass the error back to the caller. If multiple writes are concurrently issued to the same file, the write operations are put into a queue and serialized in the order they were called, using Promises. Native promises are used by default, but you can inject your own promise-\/like object with the {\bfseries Promise} option. Writes to different files are still executed in parallel.

If provided, the {\bfseries chown} option requires both {\bfseries uid} and {\bfseries gid} properties or else you\textquotesingle{}ll get an error.

The {\bfseries encoding} option is ignored if {\bfseries data} is a buffer. It defaults to \textquotesingle{}utf8\textquotesingle{}.

If the {\bfseries fsync} option is {\bfseries false}, write\+File will skip the final fsync call.

Example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
writeFileAtomic('message.txt', 'Hello Node', \{chown:\{uid:100,gid:50\}\}, function (err) \{
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('It\(\backslash\)'s saved!');
\});
\end{DoxyCode}

write\+File\+Atomic\+Sync(filename, data, \mbox{[}options\mbox{]})}

The synchronous version of {\bfseries write\+File\+Atomic}.
