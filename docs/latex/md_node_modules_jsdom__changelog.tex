\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed {\ttfamily canvas\+El.\+to\+Data\+U\+R\+L()}, with the {\ttfamily canvas} npm package installed; a recent update to the {\ttfamily canvas} package broke how we were passing arguments to do.
\item Fixed {\ttfamily data\+:} U\+RL parsing to allow empty contents, e.\+g. {\ttfamily data\+:text/css;base64,}. (sebmck)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{7.\+2.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a regression in X\+ML parsing of attributes with a namespace U\+RL but no prefix (e.\+g. {\ttfamily $<$math xmlns=\char`\"{}http\+://www.\+w3.\+org/1998/\+Math/\+Math\+M\+L\char`\"{}$>$}).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{7.\+2.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for text selection A\+P\+Is on {\ttfamily $<$input$>$} and {\ttfamily $<$textarea$>$}! (sjelin and yaycmyk)
\item Replaced our default X\+ML parser with \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/sax}{\tt sax}, thus fixing many (but not all) issues with X\+ML and X\+H\+T\+ML parsing. To get a flavor of the issues fixed, check out these now-\/closed bugs\+: \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/393}{\tt \#393}, \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/651}{\tt \#651}, \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/415}{\tt \#415}, \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/1276}{\tt \#1276}.
\item Fixed the {\ttfamily $<$canvas$>$} tag to reset its contents when its width or height changed, including the change from the default 300 × 150 canvas. (Applies only when using the {\ttfamily canvas} npm package.)
\item Fixed an issue where {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Collection}s would get confused when they contained elements with numeric {\ttfamily id}s or {\ttfamily name}s.
\item Fixed an issue with doctype parsing confusing the system ID and public ID.
\item Made the task posted by {\ttfamily post\+Message} use the inside-\/jsdom timer queue, instead of the Node.\+js one. This allows easier mocking. (cpojer)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{7.\+1.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When {\ttfamily $<$iframe$>$}s have unresolvable U\+R\+Ls, jsdom will no longer crash, but will instead just load {\ttfamily about\+:blank} into them. (This is the spec behavior.)
\item Fixed {\ttfamily document.\+writeln} to correctly handle multiple arguments; previously it ignored all after the first.
\item Fixed {\ttfamily File\+List} objects to no longer have a property named {\ttfamily \char`\"{}undefined\char`\"{}}. (jfremy)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{7.\+1.\+0}

This is a rather large release bringing with it several important re-\/implementations of D\+OM and H\+T\+ML A\+P\+Is.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Our {\ttfamily Event\+Target} implementation has been rewritten from scratch to follow the spec exactly. This should improve any edge case misbehaviors.
\item Our {\ttfamily Event} class hierarchy has been rewritten and fleshed out, fixing many gaps in functionality.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Previously missing classes {\ttfamily Keyboard\+Event} and {\ttfamily Touch\+Event} are now implemented.
\item Almost all supported {\ttfamily Event} subclasses now have constructors. ({\ttfamily Touch\+Event} does not yet, and {\ttfamily Mutation\+Event} is specified to not have one.)
\item All classes now have correct public A\+P\+Is, e.\+g. getters instead of data properties, missing properties added, and constructors that correctly allow setting all the supported properties.
\item {\ttfamily document.\+create\+Event(\char`\"{}customevent\char`\"{}, ...)} now correctly creates a {\ttfamily Custom\+Event} instead of an {\ttfamily Event}, and {\ttfamily Custom\+Event.\+prototype.\+init\+Progress\+Event} has been replaced with {\ttfamily Custom\+Event.\+prototype.\+init\+Custom\+Event}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily Attr} class and related attribute-\/manipulating methods has been rewritten to follow the latest specification. In particular, {\ttfamily Attr} is no longer a subclass of {\ttfamily Node}, and no longer has child text nodes.
\item The {\ttfamily $<$template$>$} element implementation has been greatly improved, now passing most web platform tests. Its {\ttfamily .content} property no longer has an extra intermediate document fragment; it no longer has child nodes; and related parts of the parser and serializer have been fixed, including {\ttfamily inner\+H\+T\+ML} and {\ttfamily outer\+H\+T\+ML}, to now work as specified.
\item {\ttfamily query\+Selector}, {\ttfamily query\+Selector\+All}, and {\ttfamily matches} now correctly throw {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+Syntax\+Error\char`\"{}} {\ttfamily D\+O\+M\+Exception}s for invalid selectors, instead of just {\ttfamily Error} instances.
\item {\ttfamily Node.\+prototype}\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily insert\+Before}, {\ttfamily replace\+Child}, and {\ttfamily append\+Child} methods now check their arguments more correctly.
\item The browser builds now have regained the ability to fetch U\+R\+Ls for content and the like; this had been broken due to an issue with the browser-\/request package, which is no longer necessary anyway.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{7.\+0.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed an issue where inside jsdom {\ttfamily $<$script$>$} code, {\ttfamily /regexpliteral/ instanceof Reg\+Exp} would be {\ttfamily false}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{7.\+0.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed two bugs with {\ttfamily Node.\+prototype.\+is\+Equal\+Node}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It would previously always return {\ttfamily true} for comparing any two doctypes.
\item It would throw an error when trying to compare two elements that had attributes.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Enforced that {\ttfamily document.\+implementation.\+create\+Document\+Type} requires all three of its arguments.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{7.\+0.\+0}

This major release has as its headlining feature a completely re-\/written {\ttfamily X\+M\+L\+Http\+Request} implementation, in a heroic effort by \href{https://github.com/nicolashenry}{\tt }. It includes a number of other smaller improvements and fixes. The breaking changes are highlighted in bold below.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Node.\+js 4.\+0 onward is now required}, as we have begun using E\+S2015 features only present there.
\item Completely re-\/implemented {\ttfamily X\+M\+L\+Http\+Request} and related classes (nicolashenry)\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Includes support for {\ttfamily Blob}, {\ttfamily File}, {\ttfamily File\+List}, {\ttfamily File\+Reader}, {\ttfamily Form\+Data}, {\ttfamily Progress\+Event}, and the supporting {\ttfamily X\+M\+L\+Http\+Request\+Upload}, and {\ttfamily X\+M\+L\+Http\+Request\+Event\+Target} interfaces.
\item Includes support for synchronous X\+H\+Rs.
\item Adds some new request-\/management abilities, documented in the readme. In short, the {\ttfamily pool}, {\ttfamily agent\+Options}, and {\ttfamily user\+Agent} options are new, and resource loads can now be aborted.
\item These implementations are extremely complete and standards-\/compliant, passing 136 newly-\/introduced web platform tests.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily document.\+charset}, an alias for {\ttfamily document.\+character\+Set}.
\item Added {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Template\+Element.\+prototype.\+content}, for getting the contents of a {\ttfamily $<$template$>$} element as a document fragment. (rickychien)
\item Implemented \char`\"{}loose\char`\"{} cookie parsing, giving correct execution of code like {\ttfamily document.\+cookie = \char`\"{}foo\char`\"{}}.
\item Several fixes related to event dispatching and creation, including the addition of {\ttfamily Event.\+prototype.\+stop\+Immediate\+Propagation} and the constants {\ttfamily N\+O\+NE}, {\ttfamily C\+A\+P\+T\+U\+R\+I\+N\+G\+\_\+\+P\+H\+A\+SE}, {\ttfamily A\+T\+\_\+\+T\+A\+R\+G\+ET}, and {\ttfamily B\+U\+B\+B\+L\+I\+N\+G\+\_\+\+P\+H\+A\+SE}. This accounted for another 15 newly-\/passing web platform tests. (nicolashenry)
\item Fixed {\ttfamily document.\+style\+Sheets} to correctly track the removal of stylesheets from the document. (A\+V\+GP)
\item Fixed the {\ttfamily created} jsdom lifecycle callback receiving a different {\ttfamily window} object than the {\ttfamily loaded} or {\ttfamily done} callbacks when scripting was enabled.
\item {\bfseries Invalid U\+R\+Ls are no longer allowed when creating a jsdom document}; the U\+RL must be parseable, or an error will be thrown.
\item {\bfseries The {\ttfamily \{ omit\+Jsdom\+Errors \}} option of the virtual console has moved}; it is no longer provided when creating the virtual console, but instead when calling {\ttfamily send\+To}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{6.\+5.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed an issue where with {\ttfamily jsdom.\+jsdom}, you had to pass {\ttfamily referrer} and {\ttfamily cookie} options as top-\/level, whereas with {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env}, you had to nest them under a {\ttfamily document} option. This was unnecessarily confusing. Now both possibilities are allowed for both functions. (The readme only documents the top-\/level version, though.)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{6.\+5.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily Node\+List.\+prototype\mbox{[}Symbol.\+iterator\mbox{]}}, so you can now use {\ttfamily for}-\/{\ttfamily of} loops with {\ttfamily Node\+List}s.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{6.\+4.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily jsdom.\+node\+Location(node)} to get the location within the source text of a given node.
\item Added {\ttfamily jsdom.\+reconfigure\+Window(window, \{ top \})} to allow changing the value of a window\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily top} property.
\item Added the {\ttfamily element} argument to the custom resource loader, so you can customize resource loads depending on which element loaded them.
\item Updated {\ttfamily get\+Elements\+By\+Class\+Name} to match the spec. It now correctly splits on whitespace to try to find elements with all the given classes; it returns a {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Collection} instead of a {\ttfamily Node\+List}; and it memoizes the result.
\item Updated {\ttfamily Node\+List} and {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Collection} to match the spec. The most noticable change is that {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Collection} no longer inherits from {\ttfamily Node\+List}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{6.\+3.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a fully spec-\/compliant implementation of {\ttfamily window.\+atob} and {\ttfamily window.\+btoa}. (jeffcarp)
\item Fixed many issues with our {\ttfamily $<$canvas$>$} implementation\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item With the {\ttfamily canvas} npm package installed, {\ttfamily $<$canvas$>$} elements are now properly {\ttfamily instanceof H\+T\+M\+L\+Canvas\+Element} and {\ttfamily instanceof H\+T\+M\+L\+Element}.
\item {\ttfamily $<$canvas$>$} elements now present the same uniform spec-\/compliant A\+PI both with and without the {\ttfamily canvas} npm package installed. If the package is not installed, some of the methods will cause not-\/implemented {\ttfamily \char`\"{}jsdom\+Error\char`\"{}} events to be emitted on the virtual console.
\item The {\ttfamily width} and {\ttfamily height} properties now correctly reflect the {\ttfamily width} and {\ttfamily height} attributes, and have the appropriate default values of {\ttfamily 300} and {\ttfamily 150}.
\item With the {\ttfamily canvas} npm package installed, {\ttfamily $<$canvas$>$} elements now generally play better with other parts of jsdom, e.\+g., {\ttfamily document.\+get\+Element\+By\+Id} actually works with them.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Introduced and upated many of our element classes, so that at least every tag name/element class pair is now correct, even if some of the classes are stubs. In particular\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Complete implementations were added for {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Data\+Element}, {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Span\+Element}, and {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Time\+Element}.
\item Stubs were added for {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Data\+List\+Element}, {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Dialog\+Element}, {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Embed\+Element}, {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Meter\+Element}, {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Output\+Element}, {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Progress\+Element}, {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Source\+Element}, {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Template\+Element}, and {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Track\+Element}.
\item {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Audio\+Element} was implemented in full, although its {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Media\+Element} base, where most of its functionality is, is still largely a stub.
\item {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Table\+Section\+Element}, {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Table\+Row\+Element}, {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Table\+Cell\+Element}, {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Table\+Data\+Cell\+Element}, and {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Table\+Header\+Cell\+Element} were updated to the latest spec.
\item {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Is\+Index\+Element} was removed; it has never been produced by the parser since 1.\+0.\+0-\/pre.\+1, and so it has been just a vestigial global property.
\item Appropriate constants were added to {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Media\+Element}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Updated everything having to do with base U\+R\+Ls to be per-\/spec\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily Node.\+prototype.\+base\+U\+RI} property to get the node\textquotesingle{}s owner document\textquotesingle{}s base U\+RL.
\item {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Base\+Element}\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily href} getter now contains appropriate fallbacks and always returns an absolute U\+RL, per spec.
\item If there are no {\ttfamily base} elements in an {\ttfamily \char`\"{}about\+:blank\char`\"{}} iframe document, the base U\+RL correctly falls back to the parent window\textquotesingle{}s base U\+RL.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item When you provide a {\ttfamily url\+: ...} option to {\ttfamily jsdom.\+jsom()} or {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env()}, the given string is now attempted to be resolved as a U\+RL before it is installed as {\ttfamily document.\+U\+RL}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item So for example, providing {\ttfamily url\+: \char`\"{}http\+://example.\+com\char`\"{}} will mean {\ttfamily document.\+U\+RL} returns {\ttfamily \char`\"{}http\+://example.\+com/\char`\"{}}, with a trailing slash.
\item In a future major release, we will start throwing if strings that cannot be parsed as valid absolute U\+RL are provided for this option.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{6.\+2.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a full-\/featured, spec-\/compliant {\ttfamily Element.\+prototype.\+class\+List}, closing out a three-\/year old issue! (wacii)
\item Made {\ttfamily virtual\+Console.\+send\+To(console)} forward {\ttfamily \char`\"{}jsdom\+Error\char`\"{}}s to {\ttfamily console} by calling {\ttfamily console.\+error}. This can be turned off by doing {\ttfamily virtual\+Console.\+send\+To(console, \{ omit\+Jsdom\+Errors\+: true \})}.
\item Fixed errors when trying to parse invalid doctype declarations, like {\ttfamily $<$!\+D\+O\+C\+T\+Y\+PE$>$}.
\item Fixed spurious {\ttfamily \char`\"{}jsdom\+Error\char`\"{}}s that were emitted after calling {\ttfamily window.\+close()}.
\item Fixed the {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+D\+O\+M\+Subtree\+Modified\char`\"{}} event to fire in more cases. Note that our mutation events implementation remains incomplete, and will eventually be removed (in a major release) once we implement mutation observers. (selam)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{6.\+1.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added basic implementations of {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Media\+Element} and {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Video\+Element}, back-\/ported from Facebook\textquotesingle{}s Jest project. (cpojer)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{6.\+0.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed {\ttfamily X\+M\+L\+Http\+Request.\+prototype.\+get\+All\+Response\+Headers} to not crash when used with {\ttfamily file\+:} U\+R\+Ls. (justinmchase)
\item Fixed {\ttfamily X\+M\+L\+Http\+Request.\+prototype.\+response} to correctly return the response text even when {\ttfamily response\+Type} was unset. (justinmchase)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{6.\+0.\+0}

This major release is focused on massive improvements in speed, U\+RL parsing, and error handling. The potential breaking changes are highlighted in bold below; the largest ones are around the {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env} error-\/handling paradigm.

This release also welcomes \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/commits/master?author=Joris-van-der-Wel}{\tt long-\/time contributer} \href{https://github.com/Joris-van-der-Wel/}{\tt -\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel} to the core team. You may recognize him from earlier changelogs. We\textquotesingle{}re very happy to have his help in making jsdom awesome!


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries io.\+js 2.\+0 onward is now required}, as we have begun using E\+S2015 features only present there.
\item Improved performance dramatically, by $\sim$10000x in some cases, due to the following changes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Overhauled the named properties tracker to not walk the entire tree, thus greatly speeding up the setting of {\ttfamily id} and {\ttfamily name} attributes (including during parsing).
\item Overhauled everything dealing with tree traversal to use a new library, \href{https://github.com/jsdom/js-symbol-tree}{\tt symbol-\/tree}, to turn many operations that were previously O(n$^\wedge$2) or O(n) into O(n) or O(1).
\item Sped up {\ttfamily node.\+compare\+Document\+Position} and anything that used it (like {\ttfamily node.\+contains}) by doing more intelligent tree traversal instead of directly implementing the specced algorithm.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Overhauled how error handling works in jsdom\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily window.\+onerror} (or {\ttfamily window.\+add\+Event\+Listener(\char`\"{}error\char`\"{}, ...)}) now work, and will catch all script errors, similar to in browsers. This also introduces the {\ttfamily Error\+Event} class, incidentally.
\item The virtual console is now the destination for several types of errors from jsdom, using \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom#virtual-console-jsdomerror-error-reporting}{\tt the new event {\ttfamily \char`\"{}jsdom\+Error\char`\"{}}}. This includes\+: errors loading external resources; script execution errors unhandled by {\ttfamily window.\+onerror}; and not-\/implemented warnings resulting from calling methods like {\ttfamily window.\+alert} which jsdom explicitly does not support.
\item Since script errors are now handled by {\ttfamily window.\+onerror} and the virtual console, they are no longer included in the initialization process. This results in two changes to {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env} and the initialization lifecycle\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries The {\ttfamily load(errors, window)} callback was changed to {\ttfamily onload(window)}}, to reflect that it is now just sugar for setting a {\ttfamily window.\+onload} handler.
\item {\bfseries The {\ttfamily done(errors, window)} callback (i.\+e., the default callback for {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env}) has become {\ttfamily done(error, window)}}, and like every other io.\+js callback now simply gives you a single error object, instead of an array of them.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Nodes no longer have a nonstandard {\ttfamily errors} array, or a {\ttfamily raise} method used to put things in that array.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item U\+RL parsing and resolution was entirely overhauled to follow \href{http://url.spec.whatwg.org/}{\tt the U\+RL standard}!
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This fixes several long-\/standing bugs and hacks in the jsdom U\+RL parser, which already had a mess of gross patches on top of the built-\/in io.\+js parser to be more web-\/compatible.
\item The new \href{https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url}{\tt {\ttfamily U\+RL} class} has been added to {\ttfamily window}
\item The interfaces for {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Anchor\+Element.\+prototype} and {\ttfamily document.\+location} (as well as {\ttfamily U\+RL}, of course) are now uniformized to follow the \href{https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#api}{\tt {\ttfamily U\+R\+L\+Utils} A\+PI} (minus {\ttfamily search\+Params} for now).
\item {\bfseries As part of this change, you may need to start passing in {\ttfamily file\+:} U\+R\+Ls to {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env} where previously you were able to get away with passing in filenames.}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added the {\ttfamily X\+M\+L\+Http\+Request.\+prototype.\+response} getter.
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Style\+Sheet\+List.\+prototype.\+item} to actually work. (chad3814)
\item Fixed the browser {\ttfamily vm} shim to properly add the built-\/in global properties ({\ttfamily Object}, {\ttfamily Array}, etc.) to the sandbox. If you were running jsdom inside a web worker and most of your scripts were broken, this should fix that.
\item Fixed the {\ttfamily \char`\"{}hashchange\char`\"{}} event to correctly fire {\ttfamily Hash\+Change\+Event} instances, with correct properties {\ttfamily new\+U\+RL} and {\ttfamily old\+U\+RL} (instead of the incorrect {\ttfamily new\+Url} and {\ttfamily old\+Url} used previously).
\item Removed usage of the setimmediate library, as it required {\ttfamily eval} and thus did not work in C\+SP scenarios.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Finally, if you\textquotesingle{}re a loyal jsdom fan whose made it this far into the changelog, I\textquotesingle{}d urge you to come join us in \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/1139}{\tt \#1139}, where we are brainstorming a modernized jsdom A\+PI that could get rid of many of the warts in the current one.

\subsection*{5.\+6.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed an accidentally-\/created global {\ttfamily attribute} variable if you ever called {\ttfamily create\+Attribute\+NS}.
\item Dependency upgrades fixed a couple of bugs, although you would have gotten these anyway with a clean jsdom 5.\+6.\+0 install\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Parsing of C\+SS properties that use {\ttfamily url(\char`\"{}quoted string\char`\"{})} now works correctly, as of cssstyle 0.\+2.\+29.
\item Selectors for the empty string, like {\ttfamily div\mbox{[}title=\char`\"{}\char`\"{}\mbox{]}}, now work correctly, as of nwmatcher 1.\+3.\+6.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{5.\+6.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily virtual\+Console.\+send\+To} now returns {\ttfamily this}, allowing for \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/tree/60ccb9b318d0bae8fe37e19af5af444b9c98ddac#forward-a-windows-console-output-to-the-iojs-console}{\tt a nice shorthand}. (jeffcarp)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{5.\+5.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily post\+Message} support, for communicating between parent windows, iframes, and combinations thereof. It\textquotesingle{}s missing a few semantics, especially around origins, as well as Message\+Event source. Objects are not yet structured cloned, but instead passed by reference. But it\textquotesingle{}s working, and awesome! (jeffcarp)
\item Rewrote cloning code (underlying {\ttfamily clone\+Node} and {\ttfamily import\+Node}), fixing a number of issues\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Elements with weird tag names, of the type that only the parser can normally create, can now be cloned (\href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/1142}{\tt \#1142})
\item Doctypes can now be cloned, per the latest spec.
\item Attrs cannot be cloned, per the latest spec (although they still have a {\ttfamily clone\+Node} method for now due to legacy).
\item Document clones now correctly copy over the U\+RL and content-\/type.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed any virtual console output from iframes to be proxied to the parent window\textquotesingle{}s virtual console. (jeffcarp)
\item Fixed the {\ttfamily type} property of {\ttfamily $<$button$>$} elements to correctly default to {\ttfamily submit}, and to stay within the allowed range.
\item Fixed clicking on submit {\ttfamily $<$button$>$}s to submit their containing form; previously only {\ttfamily $<$input type=\char`\"{}submit\char`\"{}$>$} worked. (rxgx)
\item Fixed {\ttfamily document.\+open()} to return {\ttfamily this}, per spec. (ryanseddon)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Additionally, Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel added \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/master/Contributing.md#running-the-benchmarks}{\tt a benchmarking framework}, and a number of benchmarks, which should help us avoid performance regressions going forward, and also make targeted performance fixes. We\textquotesingle{}re already investigating \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/1156}{\tt some real-\/world issues} using this framework. Very exciting!

\subsection*{5.\+4.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Incorporated upstream fix for setting {\ttfamily el.\+style.\+css\+Text} to an invalid value, which should be ignored instead of causing an error to be thrown. This same bug has also caused an error while setting the style attribute to an invalid value, ever since 5.\+4.\+0. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel; chad3814 upstream)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{5.\+4.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed license metadata to conform to latest npm standards.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{5.\+4.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed to work with browserify again (regression introduced in 5.\+4.\+0).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{5.\+4.\+0}

This is a pretty exciting release! It includes a couple features I never really anticipated jsdom being awesome enough to have, but our wonderful contributors powered through and made them happen anyway\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for the default H\+T\+ML stylesheet when using {\ttfamily window.\+get\+Computed\+Style}! (akhaku)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Notably, this makes j\+Query\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily show()} and {\ttfamily hide()} methods now work correctly; see \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/994}{\tt \#994}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for named properties on {\ttfamily window}\+: any elements with an {\ttfamily id} attribute, or certain elements with a {\ttfamily name} attribute, will cause properties to show up on the {\ttfamily window}, and thus as global variables within the jsdom. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Although this is fairly unfortunate browser behavior, it\textquotesingle{}s standardized and supported everywhere, so the fact that jsdom now supports this too means we can run a lot of scripts that would previously fail.
\item Previously, we only supported this for {\ttfamily $<$iframe$>$}s, and our implementation was quite buggy\+: e.\+g., {\ttfamily $<$iframe name=\char`\"{}add\+Event\+Listener\char`\"{}$>$} would override {\ttfamily window.\+add\+Event\+Listener}.
\item Now that we have the infrastructure in place, we anticipate expanding our support so that this works on e.\+g. {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Form\+Element}s as well in the future.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

We also have a bunch more fixes and additions\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Implemented the \href{https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#nondocumenttypechildnode}{\tt {\ttfamily Non\+Document\+Type\+Child\+Node}} mixin. Practically, this means adding {\ttfamily next\+Element\+Sibling} and {\ttfamily previous\+Element\+Sibling} to {\ttfamily Element} and the various types of {\ttfamily Character\+Data}. (brandon-\/bethke-\/neudesic)
\item Updated {\ttfamily Style\+Sheet\+List} to inherit from {\ttfamily Array}, as per the latest C\+S\+S\+OM spec.
\item Overhauled the handling of attributes throughout the D\+OM, to follow the spec more exactly.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Our {\ttfamily Named\+Node\+Map} implementation is up to date, as are the various {\ttfamily Element} methods; other places in the code that deal with attributes now all go through a spec-\/compliant set of helpers.
\item Some weirdnesses around the {\ttfamily style} attribute were fixed along the way; see e.\+g. \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/1109}{\tt \#1109}.
\item However, {\ttfamily Attr} objects themselves are not yet spec-\/compliant (e.\+g., they still inherit from {\ttfamily Node}). That\textquotesingle{}s coming soon.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed an unfortunate bug where {\ttfamily get\+Element\+By\+Id} would fail to work correctly on {\ttfamily $<$img$>$} elements whose {\ttfamily id} attributes were modified. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Fixed the {\ttfamily virtual\+Console} option to work with {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env}, not just {\ttfamily jsdom.\+jsdom}. (jeffcarp)
\item Removed a few functions that were erroneously added to {\ttfamily window}\+: {\ttfamily mapper}, {\ttfamily map\+D\+O\+M\+Nodes}, and {\ttfamily visit\+Tree}. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{5.\+3.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a {\ttfamily virtual\+Console} option to the document creation methods, along with the {\ttfamily jsdom.\+create\+Virtual\+Console} factory. (See \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/dbf88666d1152576237ed1c741263f5516bb4005/README.md#capturing-console-output}{\tt examples in the readme}.) With this option you can install a virtual console before the document is even created, thus allowing you to catch any virtual console events that occur during initialization. (jeffcarp)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{5.\+2.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Implemented much of the \href{https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-parentnode}{\tt {\ttfamily Parent\+Node}} mixin (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Moved {\ttfamily children} from {\ttfamily Node} to {\ttfamily Parent\+Node}, i.\+e., made it available on {\ttfamily Document}, {\ttfamily Document\+Fragment}, and {\ttfamily Element}, but not other types of nodes.
\item Made {\ttfamily children} a {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Collection} instead of a {\ttfamily Node\+List}.
\item Implemented {\ttfamily first\+Element\+Child}, {\ttfamily last\+Element\+Child}, and {\ttfamily child\+Element\+Count}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Implemented the {\ttfamily outer\+H\+T\+ML} setter. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Fixed the {\ttfamily outer\+H\+T\+ML} getter for {\ttfamily $<$select$>$} and {\ttfamily $<$form$>$}. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Fixed various issues with window-\/less documents, so that they no longer give incorrect results or blow up in strange ways. You can create such documents with e.\+g. {\ttfamily document.\+implementation.\+create\+H\+T\+M\+L\+Document()}. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Fixed relative stylesheet resolution when using {\ttfamily @import}. (dbo)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{5.\+1.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for the {\ttfamily Node\+Iterator} class from the D\+OM Standard. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Fixed an issue with the initial request where it was not sharing its cookie jar with the subsequent requests, sometimes leading to a \char`\"{}possible Event\+Emitter memory leak detected\char`\"{} warning. (inikulin)
\item Updated tough-\/cookie to 0.\+13.\+0, bringing along many spec compliance fixes. (inikulin)
\item Added a fast failure in Node.\+js™ with a clear error message, so that people don\textquotesingle{}t get confused by syntax errors.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{5.\+0.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed {\ttfamily document.\+cookie} setter to no longer ignore {\ttfamily null}; instead it correctly sets a cookie of {\ttfamily \char`\"{}null\char`\"{}}. (Chrome is not compliant to the spec in this regard.)
\item Fixed documents created with {\ttfamily parsing\+Mode\+: \char`\"{}xml\char`\"{}} to no longer get {\ttfamily \char`\"{}$<$html$>$$<$head$>$$<$/head$>$$<$body$>$$<$/body$>$$<$/html$>$\char`\"{}} automatically inserted when calling {\ttfamily jsdom.\+jsdom()} with no arguments.
\item Fixed the {\ttfamily inner\+H\+T\+ML} setter to no longer ignore {\ttfamily undefined}; instead it correctly sets the inner\+H\+T\+ML to {\ttfamily \char`\"{}undefined\char`\"{}}.
\item Fixed {\ttfamily document.\+write} to throw for X\+ML documents as per the spec.
\item Fixed {\ttfamily document.\+write} to accept more than one argument (they get concatenated).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily document.\+write(\char`\"{}\char`\"{})} to no longer try to write {\ttfamily \char`\"{}$<$html$>$$<$head$>$$<$/head$>$$<$body$>$$<$/body$>$$<$/html$>$\char`\"{}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{5.\+0.\+0}

This release overhauls how cookies are handled in jsdom to be less fiddly and more like-\/a-\/browser. The work for this was done by \href{https://github.com/inikulin}{\tt }, who is also our beloved parse5 maintainer.

You should only need to worry about upgrading to this release if you use jsdom\textquotesingle{}s cookie handling capabilities beyond the basics of reading and writing to {\ttfamily document.\+cookie}. If that describes you, here\textquotesingle{}s what changed\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed {\ttfamily options.\+jar} and {\ttfamily options.\+document.\+cookie\+Domain} from the configuration for creating jsdom documents.
\item Instead, there is now a new option, {\ttfamily options.\+cookie\+Jar}, which accepts cookie jars created by the new {\ttfamily jsdom.\+create\+Cookie\+Jar()} A\+PI. You should use this if you intend to share cookie jars among multiple jsdom documents.
\item Within a given cookie jar, cookie access is now automatically handled on a domain basis, as the browser does, with the domain calculated from the document\textquotesingle{}s U\+RL (supplied as {\ttfamily options.\+url} when creating a document). This supplants the former {\ttfamily options.\+document.\+cookie\+Domain}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

In addition to these changes to the public A\+PI, the following new cookie-\/related features came along for the ride\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Implemented automatic cookie-\/jar sharing with descendant {\ttfamily $<$iframe$>$}s. (So, if the iframe is same-\/domain, it can automatically access the appropriate cookies.)
\item Let {\ttfamily options.\+document.\+cookie} accept arrays, instead of just strings, for if you want to set multiple cookies at once.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Finally, it\textquotesingle{}s worth noting that we now delegate our cookie handling in general to the \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie}{\tt tough-\/cookie} package, which should hopefully mean that it now captures many of the behaviors that were previously missing (for example \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/1027}{\tt \#1027}).  is working on \href{https://github.com/goinstant/tough-cookie/pull/30}{\tt a large pull request to fix tough-\/cookie to be more spec compliant}, which should automatically be picked up by jsdom installs once it is merged.

\subsection*{4.\+5.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed unnecessary browserify dependency that was erroneously included in 4.\+5.\+0.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+5.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily document.\+current\+Script}. (jeffcarp)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+4.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All resources are now loaded with the \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/request}{\tt request} package, which means that e.\+g. G\+Z\+I\+Pped resources will be properly uncompressed, redirects will be followed, and more. This was previously the case only for U\+R\+Ls passed directly to {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env}, and not for sub-\/resources inside the resulting page. (ssesha)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+3.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Made the click behavior for radio buttons and checkboxes work when doing {\ttfamily el.\+dispatch\+Event(click\+Event)}, not just when doing {\ttfamily el.\+click()}. (brandon-\/bethke-\/neudesic)
\item Added {\ttfamily default\+Prevented} property to {\ttfamily Event} instances, reflecting whether {\ttfamily ev.\+prevent\+Default()} has been called. (brandon-\/bethke-\/neudesic)
\item Moved the {\ttfamily click()} method from {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Input\+Element.\+prototype} to {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Element.\+prototype}, per the latest spec.
\item Made the {\ttfamily click()} method trigger a {\ttfamily Mouse\+Event} instead of just an {\ttfamily Event}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+2.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a second parameter to {\ttfamily U\+I\+Event}, {\ttfamily Mouse\+Event}, and {\ttfamily Mutation\+Event}, which for now just behaves the same as that for {\ttfamily Event}. (Rich-\/\+Harris)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+1.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a second parameter to the {\ttfamily Event} constructor, which allows you to set the {\ttfamily bubbles} and {\ttfamily cancelable} properties. (brandon-\/bethke-\/neudesic)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+0.\+5}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Unknown\+Element} and fix the parser/{\ttfamily document.\+create\+Element} to create those instead of {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Element} for unknown elements.
\item Fixed issues with named and indexed properties on {\ttfamily window}, as well as {\ttfamily window.\+length}, with regard to {\ttfamily $<$frame$>$}s/{\ttfamily $<$iframe$>$}s being added and removed from the document.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\itshape Note\+:} this probably should have been a minor version number increment (i.\+e. 4.\+1.\+0 instead of 4.\+0.\+5), since it added {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Unknown\+Element}. We apologize for the deviation from semver.

\subsection*{4.\+0.\+4}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed parsing of doctypes by relying on the information provided by the html parser if possible.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+0.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed events fired from {\ttfamily Event\+Target}s to execute their handlers in F\+I\+FO order, as per the spec.
\item Fixed a case where {\ttfamily child\+Nodes} would not be correctly up to date in some cases. (medikoo)
\item Sped up window creation with {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env} by $\sim$600\%, for the special case when no scripts are to be executed.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+0.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Event\+Target} is now correctly in the prototype chain of {\ttfamily Window}.
\item {\ttfamily Event\+Target} argument validation is now correct according to the D\+OM Standard.
\item {\ttfamily D\+O\+M\+Exception} now behaves more like it should per Web I\+DL. In particular it has a more comprehensive set of constants, and instances now have {\ttfamily name} properties.
\item {\ttfamily new Event(\char`\"{}click\char`\"{})} can now be dispatched. (lovebear)
\item {\ttfamily document.\+create\+Event} now behaves more like it should according to the D\+OM Standard\+: it accepts a wider range of arguments, but will throw if an invalid one is given. (lovebear)
\item Fixed a regression in our browser support that required Chrome 41 as of 4.\+0.\+1; now Chrome 40 will work, as well as (in theory, although less well-\/tested) the latest stable versions of Firefox and IE.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+0.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed\+: {\ttfamily Node.\+prototype.\+contains} to always return a boolean. This was a regression in 3.\+1.\+1. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Fixed\+: {\ttfamily Document.\+prototype} no longer contains its own {\ttfamily owner\+Document} getter, instead correctly delegating to {\ttfamily Node.\+prototype}.
\item Fixed\+: some edge cases regarding running {\ttfamily $<$script$>$}s in browserified jsdom.
\item A couple fixes from updated dependencies (although you would have gotten these anyway with a fresh install, due to floating version specifiers)\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item csstyle minimum version bumped from 0.\+2.\+21 to 0.\+2.\+23, fixing handling of {\ttfamily 0} when setting numeric C\+SS properties and parsing of shorthand {\ttfamily font} declarations.
\item parse5 minimum version bumped from 1.\+3.\+1 to 1.\+3.\+2 to, fixing the parsing of {\ttfamily $<$form$>$} elements inside {\ttfamily $<$template$>$} elements.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+0.\+0}

This release relies on the newly-\/overhauled {\ttfamily vm} module of io.\+js to eliminate the Contextify native module dependency. jsdom should now be much easier to use and install, without requiring a C++ compiler toolchain!

Note that as of this release, jsdom no longer works with Node.\+js™, and instead requires io.\+js. You are still welcome to install a release in \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/tree/3.x}{\tt the 3.\+x series} if you are stuck on legacy technology like Node.\+js™.

In the process of rewriting parts of jsdom to use {\ttfamily vm}, a number of related fixes were made regarding the {\ttfamily Window} object\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In some cases, state was implicitly shared between {\ttfamily Window} instances—especially parser-\/ and serializer-\/related state. This is no longer the case, thankfully.
\item A number of properties of {\ttfamily Window} were updated for spec compliance\+: some data properties became accessors, and all methods moved from the prototype to the instance.
\item The non-\/standard {\ttfamily document.\+parent\+Window} was removed, in favor of the standard {\ttfamily document.\+default\+View}. Our apologies for encouraging use of {\ttfamily parent\+Window} in our R\+E\+A\+D\+ME, tests, and examples.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{3.\+1.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Some fixes to the {\ttfamily N\+O\+T\+\_\+\+I\+M\+P\+L\+E\+M\+E\+N\+T\+ED} internal helper, which should eliminate the cases where calling e.\+g. {\ttfamily window.\+alert} crashes your application.
\item Fixed a global variable leak when triggering {\ttfamily N\+O\+T\+\_\+\+I\+M\+P\+L\+E\+M\+E\+N\+T\+ED} methods, like {\ttfamily window.\+location.\+reload}.
\item Fixed the U\+RL resolution algorithm to handle {\ttfamily about\+:blank} properly on all systems (previously it only worked on Windows). This is especially important since as of 3.\+0.\+0 the default U\+RL is {\ttfamily about\+:blank}.
\item Fixed, at least partially, the ability to run {\ttfamily $<$script$>$}s inside a browserified jsdom instance. This is done by dynamically rewriting the source code so that global variable references become explicit references to {\ttfamily window.\+variable\+Name}, so it is not foolproof.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{3.\+1.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Updated {\ttfamily Node.\+prototype.\+is\+Equal\+Node} to the algorithm of the D\+OM Standard, fixing a bug where it would throw an error along the way.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Node.\+prototype.\+is\+Same\+Node}, which is not present in the D\+OM Standard (and was just a verbose {\ttfamily ===} check anyway).
\item Fixed a couple small issues while browserifying, mainly around {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env}. However, while doing so discovered that {\ttfamily $<$script$>$}s in general don\textquotesingle{}t work too well in a browserified jsdom; see \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/1023}{\tt \#1023}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{3.\+1.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom#custom-external-resource-loader}{\tt custom external resource loading}. (tobie)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{3.\+0.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed some stray byte-\/order marks in a couple files, which incidentally \href{https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1095}{\tt break Browserify}. (sterpe)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{3.\+0.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed another edge case where unchecking a radio button would incorrectly uncheck radio buttons outside the containing form. (zpao)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{3.\+0.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed errors when serializing text nodes (possibly only occurred when inside {\ttfamily $<$template$>$}).
\item Handle null bytes being passed to {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env}\textquotesingle{}s autodetecting capabilities. (fluffybunnies)
\item Handle empty H\+T\+ML strings being passed to {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env}\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily html} option. (fluffybunnies)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{3.\+0.\+0}

This release updates large swathes of the D\+OM A\+P\+Is to conform to the standard, mostly by removing old stuff. It also fixes a few bugs, introduces a couple new features, and changes some defaults.

3.\+0.\+x will be the last release of jsdom to support Node.\+js. All future releases (starting with 4.\+0.\+0) will require \href{https://iojs.org/}{\tt io.\+js}, whose \href{https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/CHANGELOG.md#vm}{\tt new {\ttfamily vm} module} will allow us to remove our contextify native-\/module dependency. (Given that I submitted the relevant patch to joyent/node \href{https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/7afdba6e0bc3b69c2bf5fdbd59f938ac8f7a64c5}{\tt 1.\+5 years ago}, I\textquotesingle{}m very excited that we can finally use it!)


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item By default documents now use {\ttfamily about\+:blank} as their U\+RL, instead of trying to infer some type of file U\+RL from the call site (in Node.\+js) or using {\ttfamily location.\+href} (in browsers).
\item Introduced a new \char`\"{}virtual console\char`\"{} abstraction for capturing console output from inside the page. \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom#capturing-console-output}{\tt See the readme for more information.} Note that {\ttfamily console.\+error} will no longer contribute to the (non-\/standard, and likely dying in the future) {\ttfamily window.\+errors} array. (jeffcarp)
\item Added the named {\ttfamily new Image(width, height)} constructor. (vinothkr)
\item Fixed an exception when using {\ttfamily query\+Selector} with selectors like {\ttfamily div\+:last-\/child $>$ span\mbox{[}title\mbox{]}}.
\item Removed all traces of entities, entity types, notations, default attributes, and C\+D\+A\+TA sections.
\item Differentiated between X\+ML and H\+T\+ML documents better, for example in how they handle the casing of tag names and attributes.
\item Updated {\ttfamily D\+O\+M\+Implementation} to mostly work per-\/spec, including removing {\ttfamily add\+Feature} and {\ttfamily remove\+Feature} methods, the {\ttfamily owner\+Document} property, and making {\ttfamily has\+Feature} always return {\ttfamily true}.
\item Re-\/did the {\ttfamily Character\+Data} implementation to follow the algorithms in the D\+OM Standard; this notably removes a few exceptions that were previously thrown.
\item Re-\/did {\ttfamily Comment}, {\ttfamily Text}, and {\ttfamily Processing\+Instruction} to follow the D\+OM Standard and derive from {\ttfamily Character\+Data}.
\item Re-\/did {\ttfamily Document\+Type} to follow the D\+OM Standard and be much simpler, notably removing notations, entities, and default attributes.
\item Fixed a variety of accessors on {\ttfamily Node}, {\ttfamily Element}, {\ttfamily Attr}, and {\ttfamily Document}; some were removed that were nonstandard (especially setters); others were updated to reflect the spec; etc.
\item Re-\/did name/qname validation, which is done by various A\+P\+Is, to work with the xml-\/name-\/validator package and some centralized algorithms.
\item Made the X\+ML parser at least somewhat aware of processing instructions.
\item Cleaned up doctype parsing and association between doctypes and documents. More exotic doctypes should parse better now.
\item {\ttfamily document.\+content\+Type} now is generally inferred from the parsing mode of the document.
\item Moved some properties to {\ttfamily Document.\+prototype} and {\ttfamily Window.\+prototype} instead of setting them as own properties during the document/window creation. This should improve memory usage (as well as spec compliance).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{2.\+0.\+0}

This release is largely a refactoring release to remove the defunct concept of \char`\"{}levels\char`\"{} from jsdom, in favor of the \href{https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_does_.22Living_Standard.22_mean.3F}{\tt living standard model} that browsers follow. Although the code is still organized that way, that\textquotesingle{}s now https\+://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/2ff5747488ad4b518fcef97a026c82eab42a0a14/lib/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md \char`\"{}noted as a historical artifact\char`\"{}. The public A\+PI changes while doing so were fairly minimal, but this sets the stage for a cleaner jsdom code structure going forward.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed\+: {\ttfamily jsdom.\+level}, and the {\ttfamily level} option from {\ttfamily jsdom.\+jsdom}.
\item Change\+: the nonstandard {\ttfamily Element.\+prototype.\+matches\+Selector} method was replaced with the standard {\ttfamily Element.\+prototype.\+matches}. (Ken\+Powers)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily query\+Selector} correctly coerces its argument to a string (1.\+2.\+2 previously fixed this for {\ttfamily query\+Selector\+All}).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+5.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: missing {\ttfamily window.\+console} methods, viz. {\ttfamily assert}, {\ttfamily clear}, {\ttfamily count}, {\ttfamily debug}, {\ttfamily group}, {\ttfamily group\+Collapse}, {\ttfamily group\+End}, {\ttfamily table}, {\ttfamily time}, {\ttfamily time\+End}, and {\ttfamily trace}. All except {\ttfamily assert} do nothing for now, but see \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/979}{\tt \#979} for future plans. (jeffcarp)
\item Tweak\+: make {\ttfamily child\+Nodes}, and the many places in jsdom that use it, much faster. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+4.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tweak\+: faster implementation of {\ttfamily Node\+List.\+prototype.\+length}, which should speed up common operations like {\ttfamily append\+Child} and similar. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+4.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Input\+Element.\+prototype.\+checked} and {\ttfamily default\+Checked} now behave per the spec. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Option\+Element.\+prototype.\+selected} now behaves per the spec. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Input\+Element.\+prototype.\+value} now behaves per the spec. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Text\+Area\+Element.\+prototype.\+value} and {\ttfamily default\+Value} now behave per the spec. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Add\+: {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Text\+Area\+Element.\+prototype.\+default\+Value} now has a setter, and {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Text\+Area\+Element.\+prototype.\+text\+Length} now exists. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Fix\+: resetting a {\ttfamily $<$form$>$} now behaves per spec for all different types of form elements. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Fix\+: radio buttons reset other radio buttons correctly now per the spec. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily document.\+clone\+Node} now works. (A\+V\+GP)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily has\+Attribute} is now case-\/insensitive, as it should be. (A\+V\+GP)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily div.\+to\+String()} now returns {\ttfamily \mbox{[}object H\+T\+M\+L\+Div\+Element\mbox{]}}. (A\+V\+GP)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+3.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: check if {\ttfamily module.\+parent} exists before using it to construct a document\textquotesingle{}s initial U\+RL. Apparently some testing frameworks like Jest do not correctly emulate the module environment; this compensates. (Seg\+Faultx64)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+3.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: changing attributes on {\ttfamily $<$option$>$} elements will now have the correct consequences. For example changing the {\ttfamily id} attribute now interacts correctly with {\ttfamily document.\+get\+Element\+By\+Id}. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+3.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: moved {\ttfamily focus} and {\ttfamily blur} methods to {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Element.\+prototype}, instead of having them only be present on certain element prototypes. Our focus story is still not very spec-\/compliant, but this is a step in the right direction. (vincentsiao)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+2.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tweak\+: improve performance of {\ttfamily Node.\+prototype.\+insert\+Before}, {\ttfamily Node.\+prototype.\+remove\+Child}, and several {\ttfamily Attribute\+List} methods. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+2.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily query\+Selector\+All} correctly coerces its argument to a string; notably this allows you to pass arrays. (jeffcarp)
\item Fix\+: the {\ttfamily data} setter on text nodes correctly coerces the new value to a string. (medikoo)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily document.\+to\+String()} now returns {\ttfamily \mbox{[}object H\+T\+M\+L\+Document\mbox{]}}. (jeffcarp)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+2.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: handling of {\ttfamily $<$template$>$} element parsing and serialization, now that it is supported by parse5. (inikulin)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+2.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: {\ttfamily Node\+Filter}, in particular its constants. (fhemberger)
\item Fix\+: initial {\ttfamily history.\+length} should be {\ttfamily 1}, not {\ttfamily 0}. (rgrove)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily history.\+push\+State} and {\ttfamily history.\+replace\+State} should not fire the {\ttfamily popstate} event. (rgrove)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+1.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: {\ttfamily document.\+implementation.\+create\+H\+T\+M\+L\+Document()}. (fhemberger)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily local\+Name} was sometimes {\ttfamily null} for elements when it should not be. (fhemberger)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Update\+: no longer requiring separate {\ttfamily cssstyle} and {\ttfamily cssstyle-\/browserify} dependencies; now {\ttfamily cssstyle} can be used directly. This also un-\/pins the {\ttfamily cssstyle} dependency so that future fixes arrive as they appear upstream.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: temporarily pin {\ttfamily cssstyle} dependency to at most 0.\+2.\+18 until \href{https://github.com/chad3814/CSSStyleDeclaration/issues/20}{\tt chad3814/\+C\+S\+S\+Style\+Declaration\#20} is fixed.
\item Fix\+: browserifying jsdom should work better now that the required packages are included as {\ttfamily dependencies} instead of {\ttfamily dev\+Dependencies}. (Sebmaster)
\item Fix\+: using {\ttfamily jsom.\+env} in a browser environment now correctly defaults {\ttfamily options.\+url} to {\ttfamily location.\+href} instead of trying to infer a reasonable {\ttfamily fil\+://} U\+RL using techniques that fail in the browser. (rattrayalex)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: the return value of {\ttfamily Event\+Target.\+prototype.\+dispatch\+Event} should be {\ttfamily true} when the default is {\itshape not} prevented; previously it was the opposite. (eventualbuddha)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+0}

For a consolidated list of changes from 0.\+11.\+1 to 1.\+0.\+0, see \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/wiki/Changes-from-0.11.1-to-1.0.0}{\tt this wiki page}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Remove\+: nonstandard {\ttfamily Event\+Target.\+get\+Listeners}; {\ttfamily Event\+Target.\+forward\+Iterator}; {\ttfamily Event\+Target.\+backward\+Iterator}; {\ttfamily Event\+Target.\+single\+Iterator}.
\item Remove\+: nonstandard {\ttfamily document.\+inner\+H\+T\+ML}. (jorendorff)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily value} and {\ttfamily default\+Value} properties of a {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Input\+Element} are now correctly synced to the {\ttfamily value=\char`\"{}\char`\"{}} attribute. (Sebmaster)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+0-\/pre.\+7}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Remove\+: support for old, untested H\+T\+ML and X\+ML parsers, namely davglass/node-\/htmlparser and isaacs/sax-\/js. In the future we plan to work toward a standardized parsing interface that other parsers can implement, instead of adding custom code to jsdom for various parsers. This interface still is being decided though, as it needs to support complex things like pausing the parse stream (for {\ttfamily document.\+write}) and parsing disconnected fragments (for {\ttfamily document.\+inner\+H\+T\+ML}). (Sebmaster)
\item Add\+: new {\ttfamily parsing\+Mode} configuration, to allow you to manually specify X\+ML or H\+T\+ML. (Sebmaster)
\item Change\+: jsdom will no longer use the presence of {\ttfamily $<$?xml} or similar to attempt to auto-\/detect X\+H\+T\+ML documents. Instead, it will by default treat them the same as browsers do, with the {\ttfamily $<$?xml} declaration just being a bogus comment. If you need your document interpreted as X\+H\+T\+ML instead of H\+T\+ML, use the {\ttfamily parsing\+Mode} option. (Sebmaster)
\item Tweak\+: memoize various D\+O\+M-\/querying functions (e.\+g. {\ttfamily get\+Elements\+By\+Tag\+Name}, {\ttfamily query\+Selector}, etc.) to improve performance. (ccarpita)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+0-\/pre.\+6}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: another parsing issues with void elements and {\ttfamily inner\+H\+T\+ML}, this time related to disconnected nodes. This was a regression between 0.\+11.\+1 and 1.\+0.\+0-\/pre.\+1. (paton)
\item Fix\+: same-\/named radio inputs should not be mutually exclusive unless they are in the same form. (stof)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+0-\/pre.\+5}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: sometimes calling {\ttfamily window.\+close()} would cause a segfault. (paton)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+0-\/pre.\+4}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: attributes and elements now have their {\ttfamily prefix}, {\ttfamily local\+Name}, and {\ttfamily namespace\+U\+RI} properties set correctly in all cases. (Excepting {\ttfamily application/xhtml+xml} mode, which jsdom does not support yet.) (Sebmaster)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+0-\/pre.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: void elements no longer parsed correctly when using {\ttfamily inner\+H\+T\+ML}. This was a regression between 0.\+11.\+1 and 1.\+0.\+0-\/pre.\+1. (Sebmaster)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+0-\/pre.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: parsing and serialization of attributes in the form {\ttfamily x\+:y}, e.\+g. {\ttfamily xmlns\+:xlink} or {\ttfamily xlink\+:href}. This was a regression between 0.\+11.\+1 and 1.\+0.\+0-\/pre.\+1. (Sebmaster)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+0-\/pre.\+1}

This is a prerelease of jsdom\textquotesingle{}s first major version. It incorporates several great additions, as well as a general cleanup of the A\+PI surface, which make it more backward-\/incompatible than usual. Starting with the 1.\+0.\+0 release, we will be following semantic versioning, so that you can depend on stability within major version ranges. But we still have \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.0}{\tt a few more issues} before we can get there, so I don\textquotesingle{}t want to do 1.\+0.\+0 quite yet.

This release owes a special thanks to \href{https://github.com/Sebmaster}{\tt }, for his amazing work taking on some of the hardest problems in jsdom and solving them with gusto.

\subsubsection*{Major changes}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item jsdom now can be browserified into a bundle that works in web workers! This is highly experimental, but also highly exciting! (lawnsea)
\item An overhaul of the \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom#initialization-lifecycle}{\tt initialization lifecycle}, to bring more control and address common use cases. (Sebmaster)
\item The excellent \href{https://npmjs.org/package/parse5}{\tt parse5} H\+T\+ML parser is now the default parser, fixing many parsing bugs and giving us full, official-\/test-\/suite-\/passing H\+T\+ML parsing support. This especially impacts documents that didn\textquotesingle{}t include optional tags like {\ttfamily $<$html$>$}, {\ttfamily $<$head$>$}, or {\ttfamily $<$body$>$} in their source. We also use parse5 for serialization, fixing many bugs there. (Sebmaster)
\item As part of the new parser story, we are not supporting X\+ML for now. It might work if you switch to a different parser (e.\+g. htmlparser2), but in the end, H\+T\+ML and X\+ML are very different, and we are not attempting to be an X\+ML D\+OM. That said, we eventually want to support X\+ML to the same extent browsers do (i.\+e., support X\+H\+T\+ML and S\+VG, with an appropriate M\+I\+ME type switch); this is being planned in \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/820}{\tt \#820}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Removed jsdom A\+P\+Is}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily jsdom.\+create\+Window}\+: use {\ttfamily document.\+parent\+Window} after creating a document
\item {\ttfamily jsdom.\+html}\+: use {\ttfamily jsdom.\+jsdom}
\item {\ttfamily jsdom.\+version}\+: use {\ttfamily require(\char`\"{}jsdom/package.\+json\char`\"{}).version}
\item {\ttfamily jsdom.\+level}\+: levels are deprecated and will probably be removed in 2.\+0.\+0
\item {\ttfamily jsdom.\+dom}
\item {\ttfamily jsdom.\+browser\+Augmentation}
\item {\ttfamily jsdom.\+window\+Augmentation}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Changed jsdom A\+P\+Is}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily jsdom.\+jsdom} no longer takes a level as its second argument.
\item {\ttfamily jsdom.\+j\+Queryify} now requires a j\+Query U\+RL, since \href{http://blog.jquery.com/2014/07/03/dont-use-jquery-latest-js/}{\tt always picking the latest was a bad idea}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Removed non-\/standard D\+OM A\+P\+Is}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily document.\+create\+Window}\+: use {\ttfamily document.\+parent\+Window}
\item {\ttfamily document.\+inner\+H\+T\+ML} and {\ttfamily document.\+outer\+H\+T\+ML}\+: use the new {\ttfamily jsdom.\+serialize\+Document} to include the D\+O\+C\+T\+Y\+PE, or use {\ttfamily document.\+document\+Element.\+outer\+H\+T\+ML} to omit it.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Other fixes}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Allow empty strings to be passed to {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env}. (michaelmior)
\item Fix for a memory leak in {\ttfamily Event\+Target.\+prototype.\+dispatch\+Event}. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Make event listeners in the capture phase also fire on the event target. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Correctly reset {\ttfamily event\+Phase} and {\ttfamily current\+Target} on events, before and after a dispatch. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\item Fix {\ttfamily document.\+cookie = null} to not throw, but instead just do nothing. (kapouer)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+11.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: {\ttfamily Node.\+prototype.\+parent\+Element}. (lukasbuenger)
\item Fix\+: attributes that are reflected as properties should be `'\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily when not present, instead of}null{\ttfamily . (Note that}get\+Attribute{\ttfamily still returns}null{\ttfamily for them). (thejameskyle)}
\item {\ttfamily Fix\+:}text\+Content{\ttfamily now works for nodes that do not have children, like text nodes for example. (hayes)}
\item {\ttfamily Fix\+:}jsdom.\+j\+Queryify\`{} was using the wrong U\+RL for j\+Query by default. (lukasbuenger)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+11.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: new default level, {\ttfamily living}, reflecting our focus on the \href{http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/}{\tt D\+OM Living Standard} and the \href{http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/}{\tt H\+T\+ML Living Standard}, which are what browsers actually implement. This should open the door for more features of the modern D\+OM and H\+T\+ML specs to be implemented in jsdom. (robotlovesyou)
\item Add\+: {\ttfamily Node.\+prototype.\+contains} now implemented. (robotlovesyou)
\item Add\+: {\ttfamily navigator.\+cookie\+Enabled} now implemented; it always returns {\ttfamily true}. (Sebmaster)
\item Change\+: D\+O\+C\+T\+Y\+P\+Es no longer have their {\ttfamily name} property uppercased during parsing, and appear in the output of {\ttfamily document.\+inner\+H\+T\+ML}.
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily Node.\+prototype.\+compare\+Document\+Position} implemented correctly; various document position constants added to the {\ttfamily Node} constructor. (robotlovesyou)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily Document\+Type.\+prototype.\+parent\+Node} now returns the document node, not {\ttfamily null}. (robotlovesyou)
\item Fix\+: various {\ttfamily navigator} properties are now getters, not data properties. (Sebmaster)
\item Fix\+: a bug involving invalid script paths and {\ttfamily jsdom.\+j\+Queryify}. (Sebmaster)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+10.\+6}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: remaining U\+RL properties to {\ttfamily window.\+location} and {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Anchor\+Element}.
\item Fix\+: the presence of {\ttfamily String.\+prototype.\+normalize}, which is available by default in Node 0.\+11.\+13 onwards, caused reflected attributes to break. (brock8503)
\item Fix\+: iframes now correctly load {\ttfamily about\+:blank} when the {\ttfamily src} attribute is empty or missing. (mcmathja)
\item Fix\+: documents containing only whitespace now correctly generate wrapper documents, just like blank documents do. (nikolas)
\item Tweak\+: lazy-\/load the request module, to improve overall jsdom loading time. (tantaman)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+10.\+5}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: the list of void elements has been updated to match the latest H\+T\+ML spec.
\item Fix\+: when serializing void elements, don\textquotesingle{}t include a {\ttfamily /}\+: i.\+e. the result is now {\ttfamily $<$br$>$} instead of {\ttfamily $<$br /$>$}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+10.\+4}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: another case was found where j\+Query 1.\+11\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily show()} method would cause errors.
\item Add\+: {\ttfamily query\+Selector} and {\ttfamily query\+Selector\+All} methods to {\ttfamily Document\+Fragment}s. (Joris-\/van-\/der-\/\+Wel)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+10.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: various defaults on {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Anchor\+Element} and {\ttfamily window.\+location} should not be {\ttfamily null}; they should usually be the empty string.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+10.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: Using j\+Query 1.\+11\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily show()} method would cause an error to be thrown.
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily window.\+location} properties were not updating correctly after using {\ttfamily push\+State} or {\ttfamily replace\+State}. (toomanydaves)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+10.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily window.\+location.\+port} should default to {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\char`\"{}}, not {\ttfamily null}. (bpeacock)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+10.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: a more complete {\ttfamily document.\+cookie} implementation, that supports multiple cookies. Note that options like {\ttfamily path}, {\ttfamily max-\/age}, etc. are still ignored. (dai-\/shi)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+9.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: implement attribute ordering semantics from W\+H\+A\+T\+WG D\+OM spec, and in general overhaul attribute storage implementation to be much more awesome and accurate. (lddubeau)
\item Add\+: {\ttfamily port} and {\ttfamily protocol} to {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Anchor\+Element}. (sporchia)
\item Fix\+: make {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Input\+Element} not have a {\ttfamily type} {\itshape attribute} by default. It still has a default value for the {\ttfamily type} {\itshape property}, viz. {\ttfamily \char`\"{}text\char`\"{}}. (aredridel)
\item Fix\+: treat empty namespace U\+RI as meaning \char`\"{}no namespace\char`\"{} with the {\ttfamily get\+Attribute\+NS}, {\ttfamily has\+Attribute\+NS}, and {\ttfamily set\+Attribute\+NS} functions. (lddubeau)
\item Fix\+: reference typed arrays in a way that doesn\textquotesingle{}t immediately break on Node 0.\+6. Node 0.\+6 isn\textquotesingle{}t supported in general, though. (kangax)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+8.\+11}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: store and use cookies between requests; customizable cookie jars also possible. (stockholmux)
\item Fix\+: attributes named the same as prototype properties of {\ttfamily Named\+Node\+Map} no longer break jsdom. (papandreou)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily remove\+Attribute\+NS} should not throw on missing attributes. (lddubeau)
\item Change\+: remove {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+proto\+\_\+\+\_\+}, {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+define\+Getter\+\_\+\+\_\+}, and {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+define\+Setter\+\_\+\+\_\+} usage, as part of a project to make jsdom work better across multiple environments. (lawnsea)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+8.\+10}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: {\ttfamily hash} property to {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Anchor\+Element}. (fr0z3nk0)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+8.\+9}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Upgrade\+: {\ttfamily cssom} to 0.\+3.\+0, adding support for {\ttfamily @-\/moz-\/document} and fixing a few other issues.
\item Upgrade\+: {\ttfamily cssstyle} to 0.\+2.\+6, adding support for many shorthand properties and better unit handling.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+8.\+8}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: avoid repeated {\ttfamily Node\+List.\+prototype.\+length} calculation, for a speed improvement. (peller)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+8.\+7}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: {\ttfamily host} property to {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Anchor\+Element}. (sporchia)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+8.\+6}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: stop accidentally modifying {\ttfamily Error.\+prototype}. (mitar)
\item Add\+: a dummy {\ttfamily get\+Bounding\+Client\+Rect} method, that returns {\ttfamily 0} for all properties of the rectangle, is now implemented. (F1\+L\+T3R)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+8.\+5}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: {\ttfamily href} property on {\ttfamily C\+S\+S\+Style\+Sheet} instances for external C\+SS files. (Frozen\+Cow)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+8.\+4}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: typed array constructors on the {\ttfamily window}. (nlacasse)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily query\+Selector} and {\ttfamily query\+Selector\+All} should be on the prototypes of {\ttfamily Element} and {\ttfamily Document}, not own-\/properties. (mbostock)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+8.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: when auto-\/detecting whether the first parameter to {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env} is a H\+T\+ML string or a filename, deal with long strings correctly instead of erroring. (baryshev)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+8.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: basic {\ttfamily window.\+history} support, including {\ttfamily back}, {\ttfamily forward}, {\ttfamily go}, {\ttfamily push\+State}, and {\ttfamily replace\+State}. (ralphholzmann)
\item Add\+: if an {\ttfamily $<$?xml?$>$} declaration starts the document, will try to parse as X\+ML, e.\+g. not lowercasing the tags. (robdodson)
\item Fix\+: tag names passed to {\ttfamily create\+Element} are coerced to strings before evaluating.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+8.\+1 (hotfix)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: a casing issue that prevented jsdom from loading on Unix and Solaris systems. (dai-\/shi)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily window.\+location.\+replace} was broken. (dai-\/shi)
\item Fix\+: update minimum htmlparser2 version, to ensure you get the latest parsing-\/related bugfixes.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+8.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: working {\ttfamily X\+M\+L\+Http\+Request} support, including cookie passing! (dai-\/shi)
\item Add\+: there is now a {\ttfamily window.\+navigator.\+no\+UI} property that evaluates to true, if you want to specifically distinguish jsdom in your tests.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+7.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Change\+: the logic when passing {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env} a string is more accurate, and you can be explicit by using the {\ttfamily html}, {\ttfamily url}, or {\ttfamily file} properties. This is a breaking change in the behavior of {\ttfamily html}, which used to do the same auto-\/detection logic as the string-\/only version.
\item Fix\+: errors raised in scripts are now passed to {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env}\textquotesingle{}s callback. (airportyh)
\item Fix\+: set {\ttfamily window.\+location.\+href} correctly when using {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env} to construct a window from a U\+RL, when that U\+RL causes a redirect. (fegs)
\item Add\+: a more complete and accurate {\ttfamily window.\+location} object, which includes firing {\ttfamily hashchange} events when the hash is changed. (dai-\/shi)
\item Add\+: when using a non-\/implemented feature, mention exactly what it was that is not implemented in the error message. (papandreou)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+6.\+5}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: custom attributes whose names were the same as properties of {\ttfamily Object.\+prototype}, e.\+g. {\ttfamily \char`\"{}constructor\char`\"{}}, would confuse jsdom massively.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+6.\+4}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: C\+SS selectors which contain commas inside quotes are no longer misinterpreted. (chad3814)
\item Add\+: {\ttfamily $<$img$>$} elements now fire {\ttfamily \char`\"{}load\char`\"{}} events when their {\ttfamily src} attributes are changed. (kapouer)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+6.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: better automatic detection of U\+R\+Ls vs. H\+T\+ML fragments when using {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env}. (jden)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+6.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: U\+RL resolution to be amazing and extremely browser-\/compatible, including the interplay between the document\textquotesingle{}s original U\+RL, any {\ttfamily $<$base$>$} tags that were set, and any relative {\ttfamily href}s. This impacts many parts of jsdom having to do with external resources or accurate {\ttfamily href} and {\ttfamily src} attributes. (deitch)
\item Add\+: access to frames and iframes via named properties. (adrianlang)
\item Fix\+: node-\/canvas integration, which had been broken since 0.\+5.\+7.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+6.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make the code parseable with Esprima. (squarooticus)
\item Use the correct {\ttfamily package.\+json} field {\ttfamily \char`\"{}repository\char`\"{}} instead of {\ttfamily \char`\"{}repositories\char`\"{}} to prevent npm warnings. (jonathanong)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+6.\+0}

Integrated a new H\+T\+ML parser, \href{https://npmjs.org/package/htmlparser2}{\tt htmlparser2}, from fb55. This is an actively maintained and much less buggy parser, fixing many of our parsing issues, including\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Parsing elements with optional closing tags, like {\ttfamily $<$p$>$} or {\ttfamily $<$td$>$}.
\item The {\ttfamily inner\+H\+T\+ML} of {\ttfamily $<$script$>$} tags no longer cuts off the first character.
\item Empty attributes now have {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\char`\"{}} as their value instead of the attribute name.
\item Multiline attributes no longer get horribly mangled.
\item Attribute names can now be any value allowed by H\+T\+M\+L5, including crazy things like {\ttfamily $^\wedge$}.
\item Attribute values can now contain any value allowed by H\+T\+M\+L5, including e.\+g. {\ttfamily $>$} and {\ttfamily $<$}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+5.\+7}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: make event handlers attached via {\ttfamily on$<$event$>$} more spec-\/compatible, supporting {\ttfamily return false} and passing the {\ttfamily event} argument. (adrianlang)
\item Fix\+: make the getter for {\ttfamily text\+Content} more accurate, e.\+g. in cases involving comment nodes or processing instruction nodes. (adrianlang)
\item Fix\+: make {\ttfamily $<$canvas$>$} behave like a {\ttfamily $<$div$>$} when the {\ttfamily node-\/canvas} package isn\textquotesingle{}t available, instead of crashing. (stepheneb)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+5.\+6}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily on$<$event$>$} properties are correctly updated when using {\ttfamily set\+Attribute\+Node}, {\ttfamily attribute\+Node.\+value =}, {\ttfamily remove\+Attribute}, and {\ttfamily remove\+Attribute\+Node}; before it only worked with {\ttfamily set\+Attribute}. (adrianlang)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Collection}s now have named properties based on their members\textquotesingle{} {\ttfamily id} and {\ttfamily name} attributes, e.\+g. {\ttfamily form.\+elements.\+input\+Id} is now present. (adrianlang)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+5.\+5}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily read\+Only} and {\ttfamily selected} properties were not correct when their attribute values were falsy, e.\+g. {\ttfamily $<$option selected=\char`\"{}\char`\"{}$>$}. (adrianlang)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+5.\+4}

This release, and all future releases, require at least Node.\+js 0.\+8.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add\+: parser can now be set via {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env} configuration. (xavi-\/)
\item Fix\+: accessing {\ttfamily row\+Index} for table rows that are not part of a table would throw. (medikoo)
\item Fix\+: several places in the code accidentally created global variables, or referenced nonexistant values. (xavi-\/)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily $<$img$>$} elements\textquotesingle{} {\ttfamily src} properties now evaluate relative to {\ttfamily location.\+href}, just like {\ttfamily $<$a$>$} elements\textquotesingle{} {\ttfamily href} properties. (brianmaissy)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+5.\+3}

This release is compatible with Node.\+js 0.\+6, whereas all future releases will require at least Node.\+js 0.\+8.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily get\+Attribute\+NS} now returns {\ttfamily null} for attributes that are not present, just like {\ttfamily get\+Attribute}. (mbostock)
\item Change\+: {\ttfamily \char`\"{}request\char`\"{}} dependency pinned to version 2.\+14 for Node.\+js 0.\+6 compatibility.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+5.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: stylesheets with {\ttfamily @-\/webkit-\/keyframes} rules were crashing calls to {\ttfamily get\+Computed\+Style}.
\item Fix\+: handling of {\ttfamily features} option to {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env}.
\item Change\+: retain the value of the {\ttfamily style} attribute until the element\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily style} property is touched. (papandreou)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+5.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily selected\+Index} now changes correctly in response to {\ttfamily $<$option$>$} elements being selected. This makes {\ttfamily $<$select$>$} elements actually work like you would want, especially with j\+Query. (xcoderzach)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily checked} works correctly on radio buttons, i.\+e. only one can be checked and clicking on one does not uncheck it. Previously they worked just like checkboxes. (xcoderzach)
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily click()} on {\ttfamily $<$input$>$} elements now fires a click event. (xcoderzach)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+5.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: Make {\ttfamily contextify} a non-\/optional dependency. jsdom never worked without it, really, so this just caused confusion.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+4.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily selected} now returns true for the first {\ttfamily $<$option$>$} in a {\ttfamily $<$select$>$} if nothing is explicitly set.
\item Fix\+: tweaks to accuracy and speed of the {\ttfamily query\+Selector\+All} implementation.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+4.\+1 (hotfix)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: crashes when loading H\+T\+ML files with {\ttfamily $<$a$>$} tags with no {\ttfamily href} attribute. (eleith)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+4.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily get\+Attribute} now returns {\ttfamily null} for attributes that are not present, as per D\+O\+M4 (but in contradiction to D\+O\+M1 through D\+O\+M3).
\item Fix\+: static {\ttfamily Node\+List}-\/returning methods (such as {\ttfamily query\+Selector\+All}) now return a real {\ttfamily Node\+List} instance.
\item Change\+: {\ttfamily Node\+List}s no longer expose nonstandard properties to the world, like {\ttfamily to\+Array}, without first prefixing them with an underscore.
\item Change\+: {\ttfamily Node\+List}s no longer inconsistently have array methods. Previously, live node lists would have {\ttfamily index\+Of}, while static node lists would have them all. Now, they have no array methods at all, as is correct per the specification.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+3.\+4}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: stylesheets with {\ttfamily @media} rules were crashing calls to {\ttfamily get\+Computed\+Style}, e.\+g. those in j\+Query\textquotesingle{}s initialization.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+3.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: make {\ttfamily document.\+write} calls insert new elements correctly. (johanoverip, kblomquist).
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily $<$input$>$} tags with no {\ttfamily type} attribute now return a default value of {\ttfamily \char`\"{}text\char`\"{}} when calling {\ttfamily input\+El.\+get\+Attribute(\char`\"{}type\char`\"{})}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+3.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: stylesheets with \char`\"{}joining\char`\"{} rules (i.\+e. those containing comma-\/separated selectors) now apply when using {\ttfamily get\+Computed\+Style}. (chad3814, godmar)
\item Add\+: support for running the tests using \textquotesingle{}s \href{https://npmjs.org/package/html5}{\tt html5} parser, as a prelude toward maybe eventually making this the default and fixing various parsing bugs.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+3.\+1 (hotfix)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: crashes when invalid selectors were present in stylesheets.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+3.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: a real {\ttfamily query\+Selector} implementation, courtesy of the nwmatcher project, solves many outstanding {\ttfamily query\+Selector} bugs.
\item Add\+: {\ttfamily matches\+Selector}, again via nwmatcher.
\item Add\+: support for styles coming from {\ttfamily $<$style$>$} and {\ttfamily $<$link rel=\char`\"{}stylesheet\char`\"{}$>$} elements being applied to the results of {\ttfamily window.\+get\+Computed\+Style}. (chad3814)
\item Add\+: basic implementation of {\ttfamily focus()} and {\ttfamily blur()} methods on appropriate elements. More work remains.
\item Fix\+: script filenames containing spaces will now work when passed to {\ttfamily jsdom.\+env}. (Tom\+Nom\+Nom)
\item Fix\+: elements with I\+Ds {\ttfamily to\+String}, {\ttfamily has\+Own\+Property}, etc. could cause lots of problems.
\item Change\+: A window\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily load} event always fires asynchronously now, even if no external resources are necessary.
\item Change\+: turning off mutation events is not supported, since doing so breaks external-\/resource fetching.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+2.\+19}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: U\+RL resolution was broken on pages that included {\ttfamily href}-\/less {\ttfamily $<$base$>$} tags.
\item Fix\+: avoid putting {\ttfamily attr} in the global scope when using node-\/canvas. (starsquare)
\item Add\+: New {\ttfamily Skip\+External\+Resources} feature accepts a regular expression. (fgalassi)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+2.\+18}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Un-\/revert\+: cssstyle has fixed its memory problems, so we get back accurate {\ttfamily css\+Text} and {\ttfamily style} properties again.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+2.\+17 (hotfix)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Revert\+: had to revert the use of the cssstyle package. {\ttfamily css\+Text} and {\ttfamily style} properties are no longer as accurate.
\item Fix\+: cssstyle was causing out-\/of-\/memory errors on some larger real-\/world pages, e.\+g. reddit.\+com.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+2.\+16}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Update\+: Sizzle version updated to circa September 2012.
\item Fix\+: when setting a text node\textquotesingle{}s value to a falsy value, convert it to a string instead of coercing it to {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\char`\"{}}.
\item Fix\+: Use the cssstyle package for {\ttfamily C\+S\+S\+Style\+Declaration}, giving much more accurate {\ttfamily css\+Text} and {\ttfamily style} properties on all elements. (chad3814)
\item Fix\+: the {\ttfamily checked} property on checkboxes and radiobuttons now reflects the attribute correctly.
\item Fix\+: {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L\+Option\+Element}\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily text} property should return the option\textquotesingle{}s text, not its value.
\item Fix\+: make the {\ttfamily name} property only exist on certain specific tags, and accurately reflect the corresponding {\ttfamily name} attribute.
\item Fix\+: don\textquotesingle{}t format {\ttfamily outer\+H\+T\+ML} (especially important for {\ttfamily $<$pre$>$} elements).
\item Fix\+: remove the {\ttfamily value} property from {\ttfamily Text} instances (e.\+g. text nodes).
\item Fix\+: don\textquotesingle{}t break in the presence of a {\ttfamily String.\+prototype.\+normalize} method, like that of sugar.\+js.
\item Fix\+: include level3/xpath correctly.
\item Fix\+: many more tests passing, especially related to \href{file:///}{\tt file\+:///} U\+R\+Ls on Windows. Tests can now be run with {\ttfamily npm test}.

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+2.\+14}
