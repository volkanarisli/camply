Significant refactor of {\ttfamily copy()} \& {\ttfamily copy\+Sync()}, including breaking changes. No changes to other functions in this release.

Huge thanks to {\bfseries \href{https://github.com/manidlou}{\tt }} for doing most of the work on this release.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily filter} option can no longer be a Reg\+Exp (must be a function). This was deprecated since fs-\/extra v1.\+0.\+0. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/512}{\tt \#512}
\item {\ttfamily copy()}\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily filter} option can now be a function that returns a Promise. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/518}{\tt \#518}
\item {\ttfamily copy()} \& {\ttfamily copy\+Sync()} now use {\ttfamily fs.\+copy\+File()}/{\ttfamily fs.\+copy\+File\+Sync()} in environments that support it (currently Node 8.\+5.\+0+). Older Node versions still get the old implementation. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/505}{\tt \#505}
\item Don\textquotesingle{}t allow copying a directory into itself. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/83}{\tt \#83}
\item Handle copying between identical files. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/198}{\tt \#198}
\item Error out when copying an empty folder to a path that already exists. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/464}{\tt \#464}
\item Don\textquotesingle{}t create {\ttfamily dest}\textquotesingle{}s parent if the {\ttfamily filter} function aborts the {\ttfamily copy()} operation. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/517}{\tt \#517}
\item Fix {\ttfamily write\+Stream} not being closed if there was an error in {\ttfamily copy()}. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/516}{\tt \#516}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+0.\+3 / 2017-\/12-\/05 }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix wrong {\ttfamily chmod} values in {\ttfamily fs.\+remove()} \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/501}{\tt \#501}
\item Fix {\ttfamily Type\+Error} on systems that don\textquotesingle{}t have some {\ttfamily fs} operations like {\ttfamily lchown} \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/520}{\tt \#520}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+0.\+2 / 2017-\/09-\/12 }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily E\+OL} option to {\ttfamily write\+Json$\ast$} \& {\ttfamily output\+Json$\ast$} (via upgrade to jsonfile v4)
\item Added promise support to \href{https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_copyfile_src_dest_flags_callback}{\tt {\ttfamily fs.\+copy\+File()}} in Node 8.\+5+
\item Added {\ttfamily .js} extension to {\ttfamily main} field in {\ttfamily package.\+json} for better tooling compatibility. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/485}{\tt \#485}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+0.\+1 / 2017-\/07-\/31 }

\subsubsection*{Fixed}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Previously, {\ttfamily ensure\+File()} \& {\ttfamily ensure\+File\+Sync()} would do nothing if the path was a directory. Now, they error out for consistency with {\ttfamily ensure\+Dir()}. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/465}{\tt \#465}, \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/466}{\tt \#466}, \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/470}{\tt \#470}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+0.\+0 / 2017-\/07-\/14 }

\subsubsection*{Changed}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries B\+R\+E\+A\+K\+I\+NG\+:} The promisified versions of {\ttfamily fs.\+read()} \& {\ttfamily fs.\+write()} now return objects. See the docs for details. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/436}{\tt \#436}, \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/449}{\tt \#449}
\item {\ttfamily fs.\+move()} now errors out when destination is a subdirectory of source. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/458}{\tt \#458}
\item Applied upstream fixes from {\ttfamily rimraf} to {\ttfamily fs.\+remove()} \& {\ttfamily fs.\+remove\+Sync()}. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/459}{\tt \#459}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Fixed}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Got {\ttfamily fs.\+output\+J\+S\+O\+N\+Sync()} working again; it was broken due to refactoring. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/428}{\tt \#428}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Also clarified the docs in a few places.

\subsection*{3.\+0.\+1 / 2017-\/05-\/04 }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix bug in {\ttfamily move()} \& {\ttfamily move\+Sync()} when source and destination are the same, and source does not exist. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/415}{\tt \#415}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{3.\+0.\+0 / 2017-\/04-\/27 }

\subsubsection*{Added}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries B\+R\+E\+A\+K\+I\+NG\+:} Added Promise support. All asynchronous native fs methods and fs-\/extra methods now return a promise if the callback is not passed. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/403}{\tt \#403}
\item {\ttfamily path\+Exists()}, a replacement for the deprecated {\ttfamily fs.\+exists}. {\ttfamily path\+Exists} has a normal error-\/first callback signature. Also added {\ttfamily path\+Exists\+Sync}, an alias to {\ttfamily fs.\+exists\+Sync}, for completeness. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/406}{\tt \#406}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Removed}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries B\+R\+E\+A\+K\+I\+NG\+:} Removed support for setting the default spaces for {\ttfamily write\+Json()}, {\ttfamily write\+Json\+Sync()}, {\ttfamily output\+Json()}, \& {\ttfamily output\+Json\+Sync()}. This was undocumented. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402}{\tt \#402}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Changed}


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries B\+R\+E\+A\+K\+I\+NG\+:} Changed behavior of {\ttfamily throws} option for {\ttfamily read\+Json\+Sync()}; now does not throw filesystem errors when {\ttfamily throws} is {\ttfamily false}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries B\+R\+E\+A\+K\+I\+NG\+:} {\ttfamily write\+Json()}, {\ttfamily write\+Json\+Sync()}, {\ttfamily output\+Json()}, \& {\ttfamily output\+Json\+Sync()} now output minified J\+S\+ON by default for consistency with {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N.\+stringify()}; set the {\ttfamily spaces} option to {\ttfamily 2} to override this new behavior. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402}{\tt \#402}
\item Use {\ttfamily Buffer.\+alloc\+Unsafe()} instead of {\ttfamily new Buffer()} in environments that support it. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/394}{\tt \#394}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Fixed}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily remove\+Sync()} silently failed on Windows in some cases. Now throws an {\ttfamily E\+B\+U\+SY} error. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/408}{\tt \#408}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{2.\+1.\+2 / 2017-\/03-\/16 }

\subsubsection*{Fixed}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Weird windows bug that resulted in {\ttfamily ensure\+Dir()}\textquotesingle{}s callback being called twice in some cases. This bug may have also affected {\ttfamily remove()}. See \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/392}{\tt \#392}, \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/393}{\tt \#393}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{2.\+1.\+1 / 2017-\/03-\/15 }

\subsubsection*{Fixed}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Reverted \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/commit/5597bd5b67f7d060f5f5bf26e9635be48330f5d7}{\tt {\ttfamily 5597bd}}, this broke compatibility with Node.\+js versions v4+ but less than {\ttfamily v4.\+5.\+0}.
\item Remove {\ttfamily Buffer.\+alloc()} usage in {\ttfamily move\+Sync()}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{2.\+1.\+0 / 2017-\/03-\/15 }

Thanks to \href{https://github.com/manidlou}{\tt Mani Maghsoudlou ()} \& \href{https://github.com/JPeer264}{\tt Jan Peer Stöcklmair ()} for their extraordinary help with this release!

\subsubsection*{Added}

\item {\ttfamily copy()} and {\ttfamily copy\+Sync()}\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily filter} option now gets the destination path passed as the second parameter. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/366}{\tt \#366} (\href{https://github.com/manidlou}{\tt })
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Changed}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use {\ttfamily Buffer.\+alloc()} instead of deprecated {\ttfamily new Buffer()} in {\ttfamily copy\+Sync()}. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/380}{\tt \#380} (\href{https://github.com/manidlou}{\tt })
\item Refactored entire codebase to use E\+S6 features supported by Node.\+js v4+ \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/355}{\tt \#355}. \href{https://github.com/JPeer264}{\tt ()}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{2.\+0.\+0 / 2017-\/01-\/16 }

\subsubsection*{Removed}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries B\+R\+E\+A\+K\+I\+NG\+:} Removed support for Node {\ttfamily v0.\+12}. The Node foundation stopped officially supporting it on Jan 1st, 2017.
\item {\bfseries B\+R\+E\+A\+K\+I\+NG\+:} Remove {\ttfamily walk()} and {\ttfamily walk\+Sync()}. {\ttfamily walk\+Sync()} was only part of {\ttfamily fs-\/extra} for a little over two months. Use \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw}{\tt klaw} instead of {\ttfamily walk()}, in fact, {\ttfamily walk()} was just an alias to klaw. For {\ttfamily walk\+Sync()} use \href{https://github.com/mawni/node-klaw-sync}{\tt klaw-\/sync}. See\+: \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/338}{\tt \#338}, \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/339}{\tt \#339}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Changed}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries B\+R\+E\+A\+K\+I\+NG\+:} Renamed {\ttfamily clobber} to {\ttfamily overwrite}. This affects {\ttfamily copy()}, {\ttfamily copy\+Sync()}, and {\ttfamily move()}. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/330}{\tt \#330}, \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/333}{\tt \#333}
\item Moved docs, to {\ttfamily docs/}. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/340}{\tt \#340}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Fixed}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Apply filters to directories in {\ttfamily copy\+Sync()} like in {\ttfamily copy()}. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/324}{\tt \#324}
\item A specific condition when disk is under heavy use, {\ttfamily copy()} can fail. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/326}{\tt \#326}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+0 / 2016-\/11-\/01 }

\item deprecate {\ttfamily copy()/copy\+Sync()} option {\ttfamily filter} if it\textquotesingle{}s a {\ttfamily Reg\+Exp}. {\ttfamily filter} should now be a function.
\item inline {\ttfamily rimraf}. This is temporary and was done because {\ttfamily rimraf} depended upon the beefy {\ttfamily glob} which {\ttfamily fs-\/extra} does not use. \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/300}{\tt \#300}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Fixed}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+26.\+3 / 2015-\/12-\/17 }


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item removed alias {\ttfamily delete()} and {\ttfamily delete\+Sync()}. See\+: \href{https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/171}{\tt \#171}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+23.\+1 / 2015-\/08-\/07 }

\subsection*{0.\+20.\+0 / 2015-\/06-\/19 }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item removed {\ttfamily jsonfile} aliases with {\ttfamily File} in the name, they weren\textquotesingle{}t documented and probably weren\textquotesingle{}t in use e.\+g. this package had both {\ttfamily fs.\+read\+Json\+File} and {\ttfamily fs.\+read\+Json} that were aliases to each other, now use {\ttfamily fs.\+read\+Json}.
\item preliminary walker created. Intentionally not documented. If you use it, it will almost certainly change and break your code.
\item started moving tests inline
\item upgraded to {\ttfamily jsonfile@2.\+1.\+0}, can now pass J\+S\+ON revivers/replacers to {\ttfamily read\+Json()}, {\ttfamily write\+Json()}, {\ttfamily output\+Json()}
\end{DoxyItemize}
