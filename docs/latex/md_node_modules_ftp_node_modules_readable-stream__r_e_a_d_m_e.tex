{\itshape {\bfseries Node-\/core streams for userland}}

\href{https://nodei.co/npm/readable-stream/}{\tt } \href{https://nodei.co/npm/readable-stream/}{\tt }

This package is a mirror of the Streams2 and Streams3 implementations in Node-\/core.

If you want to guarantee a stable streams base, regardless of what version of Node you, or the users of your libraries are using, use {\bfseries readable-\/stream} {\itshape only} and avoid the $\ast$\char`\"{}stream\char`\"{}$\ast$ module in Node-\/core.

{\bfseries readable-\/stream} comes in two major versions, v1.\+0.\+x and v1.\+1.\+x. The former tracks the Streams2 implementation in Node 0.\+10, including bug-\/fixes and minor improvements as they are added. The latter tracks Streams3 as it develops in Node 0.\+11; we will likely see a v1.\+2.\+x branch for Node 0.\+12.

{\bfseries readable-\/stream} uses proper patch-\/level versioning so if you pin to {\ttfamily \char`\"{}$\sim$1.\+0.\+0\char`\"{}} you’ll get the latest Node 0.\+10 Streams2 implementation, including any fixes and minor non-\/breaking improvements. The patch-\/level versions of 1.\+0.\+x and 1.\+1.\+x should mirror the patch-\/level versions of Node-\/core releases. You should prefer the {\bfseries 1.\+0.\+x} releases for now and when you’re ready to start using Streams3, pin to {\ttfamily \char`\"{}$\sim$1.\+1.\+0\char`\"{}}
