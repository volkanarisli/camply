\section*{v2.\+0.\+0}

Lots of changes here!

First and foremost, we have a slick new \href{https://caolan.github.io/async/}{\tt site for docs}. Special thanks to \href{https://github.com/hargasinski}{\tt {\bfseries }} for his work converting our old docs to {\ttfamily jsdoc} format and implementing the new website. Also huge ups to \href{https://github.com/ivanseidel}{\tt {\bfseries }} for designing our new logo. It was a long process for both of these tasks, but I think these changes turned out extraordinary well.

The biggest feature is modularization. You can now {\ttfamily require(\char`\"{}async/series\char`\"{})} to only require the {\ttfamily series} function. Every Async library function is available this way. You still can {\ttfamily require(\char`\"{}async\char`\"{})} to require the entire library, like you could do before.

We also provide Async as a collection of E\+S2015 modules. You can now `import \{each\} from \textquotesingle{}async-\/es'{\ttfamily or}import waterfall from \textquotesingle{}async-\/es/waterfall\textquotesingle{}\`{}. If you are using only a few Async functions, and are using a ES bundler such as Rollup, this can significantly lower your build size.

Major thanks to \href{github.com/Kikobeats}{\tt {\bfseries }}, \href{github.com/aearly}{\tt {\bfseries }} and \href{github.com/megawac}{\tt {\bfseries }} for doing the majority of the modularization work, as well as \href{github.com/jdalton}{\tt {\bfseries }} and \href{github.com/Rich-Harris}{\tt {\bfseries -\/\+Harris}} for advisory work on the general modularization strategy.

Another one of the general themes of the 2.\+0 release is standardization of what an \char`\"{}async\char`\"{} function is. We are now more strictly following the node-\/style continuation passing style. That is, an async function is a function that\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Takes a variable number of arguments
\item The last argument is always a callback
\item The callback can accept any number of arguments
\item The first argument passed to the callback will be treated as an error result, if the argument is truthy
\item Any number of result arguments can be passed after the \char`\"{}error\char`\"{} argument
\item The callback is called once and exactly once, either on the same tick or later tick of the Java\+Script event loop.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

There were several cases where Async accepted some functions that did not strictly have these properties, most notably {\ttfamily auto}, {\ttfamily every}, {\ttfamily some}, {\ttfamily filter}, {\ttfamily reject} and {\ttfamily detect}.

Another theme is performance. We have eliminated internal deferrals in all cases where they make sense. For example, in {\ttfamily waterfall} and {\ttfamily auto}, there was a {\ttfamily set\+Immediate} between each task -- these deferrals have been removed. A {\ttfamily set\+Immediate} call can add up to 1ms of delay. This might not seem like a lot, but it can add up if you are using many Async functions in the course of processing a H\+T\+TP request, for example. Nearly all asynchronous functions that do I/O already have some sort of deferral built in, so the extra deferral is unnecessary. The trade-\/off of this change is removing our built-\/in stack-\/overflow defense. Many synchronous callback calls in series can quickly overflow the JS call stack. If you do have a function that is sometimes synchronous (calling its callback on the same tick), and are running into stack overflows, wrap it with {\ttfamily async.\+ensure\+Async()}.

Another big performance win has been re-\/implementing {\ttfamily queue}, {\ttfamily cargo}, and {\ttfamily priority\+Queue} with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list}{\tt doubly linked lists} instead of arrays. This has lead to queues being an order of \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/pull/1205}{\tt magnitude faster on large sets of tasks}.

\subsection*{New Features}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Async is now modularized. Individual functions can be {\ttfamily require()}d from the main package.

\item {\ttfamily Added}auto\+Inject{\ttfamily , a relative of}auto{\ttfamily that automatically spreads a task\textquotesingle{}s dependencies as arguments to the task function. (\mbox{[}\#608\mbox{]}(\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/608}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/caolan/async/issues/608}), \mbox{[}\#1055\mbox{]}(\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1055}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/caolan/async/issues/1055}), \mbox{[}\#1099\mbox{]}(\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1099}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/caolan/async/issues/1099}), \mbox{[}\#1100\mbox{]}(\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1100}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/caolan/async/issues/1100}))}

(\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1088}{\tt \#1088})
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Breaking changes}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Calling a callback more than once is considered an error, and an error will be thrown. This had an explicit breaking change in {\ttfamily waterfall}. If you were relying on this behavior, you should more accurately represent your control flow as an event emitter or stream. (\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/814}{\tt \#814}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/815}{\tt \#815}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1048}{\tt \#1048}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1050}{\tt \#1050})
\item {\ttfamily auto} task functions now always take the callback as the last argument. If a task has dependencies, the {\ttfamily results} object will be passed as the first argument. To migrate old task functions, wrap them with \href{https://lodash.com/docs#flip}{\tt {\ttfamily \+\_\+.\+flip}} (\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1036}{\tt \#1036}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1042}{\tt \#1042})
\item Internal {\ttfamily set\+Immediate} calls have been refactored away. This may make existing flows vulnerable to stack overflows if you use many synchronous functions in series. Use {\ttfamily ensure\+Async} to work around this. (\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/696}{\tt \#696}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/704}{\tt \#704}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1049}{\tt \#1049}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1050}{\tt \#1050})
\item {\ttfamily map} used to return an object when iterating over an object. {\ttfamily map} now always returns an array, like in other libraries. The previous object behavior has been split out into {\ttfamily map\+Values}. (\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1157}{\tt \#1157}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1177}{\tt \#1177})
\item {\ttfamily filter}, {\ttfamily reject}, {\ttfamily some}, {\ttfamily every}, {\ttfamily detect} and their families like {\ttfamily \{M\+E\+T\+H\+OD\}Series} and {\ttfamily \{M\+E\+T\+H\+OD\}Limit} now expect an error as the first callback argument, rather than just a simple boolean. Pass {\ttfamily null} as the first argument, or use {\ttfamily fs.\+access} instead of {\ttfamily fs.\+exists}. (\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/118}{\tt \#118}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/774}{\tt \#774}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1028}{\tt \#1028}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1041}{\tt \#1041})
\item {\ttfamily \{M\+E\+T\+H\+OD\}} and {\ttfamily \{M\+E\+T\+H\+OD\}Series} are now implemented in terms of {\ttfamily \{M\+E\+T\+H\+OD\}Limit}. This is a major internal simplification, and is not expected to cause many problems, but it does subtly affect how functions execute internally. (\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/778}{\tt \#778}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/847}{\tt \#847})
\item {\ttfamily retry}\textquotesingle{}s callback is now optional. Previously, omitting the callback would partially apply the function, meaning it could be passed directly as a task to {\ttfamily series} or {\ttfamily auto}. The partially applied \char`\"{}control-\/flow\char`\"{} behavior has been separated out into {\ttfamily retryable}. (\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1054}{\tt \#1054}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1058}{\tt \#1058})
\item The test function for {\ttfamily whilst}, {\ttfamily until}, and {\ttfamily during} used to be passed non-\/error args from the iteratee function\textquotesingle{}s callback, but this led to weirdness where the first call of the test function would be passed no args. We have made it so the test function is never passed extra arguments, and only the {\ttfamily do\+Whilst}, {\ttfamily do\+Until}, and {\ttfamily do\+During} functions pass iteratee callback arguments to the test function (\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1217}{\tt \#1217}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1224}{\tt \#1224})
\item The {\ttfamily q.\+tasks} array has been renamed {\ttfamily q.\+\_\+tasks} and is now implemented as a doubly linked list (D\+LL). Any code that used to interact with this array will need to be updated to either use the provided helpers or support D\+L\+Ls (\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1205}{\tt \#1205}).
\item The timing of the {\ttfamily q.\+saturated()} callback in a {\ttfamily queue} has been modified to better reflect when tasks pushed to the queue will start queueing. (\href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/724}{\tt \#724}, \href{https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1078}{\tt \#1078})
