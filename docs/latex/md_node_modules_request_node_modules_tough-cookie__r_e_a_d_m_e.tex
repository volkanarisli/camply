\section*{Synopsis}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var tough = require('tough-cookie');
var Cookie = tough.Cookie;
var cookie = Cookie.parse(header);
cookie.value = 'somethingdifferent';
header = cookie.toString();

var cookiejar = new tough.CookieJar();
cookiejar.setCookie(cookie, 'http://currentdomain.example.com/path', cb);
// ...
cookiejar.getCookies('http://example.com/otherpath',function(err,cookies) \{
  res.headers['cookie'] = cookies.join('; ');
\});
\end{DoxyCode}


\section*{Installation}

It\textquotesingle{}s {\itshape so} easy!

{\ttfamily npm install tough-\/cookie}

Why the name? N\+PM modules {\ttfamily cookie}, {\ttfamily cookies} and {\ttfamily cookiejar} were already taken.

\subsection*{Version Support}

Support for versions of node.\+js will follow that of the \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/request}{\tt request} module.

\section*{A\+PI}

\subsection*{tough}

Functions on the module you get from `require(\textquotesingle{}tough-\/cookie')\`{}. All can be used as pure functions and don\textquotesingle{}t need to be \char`\"{}bound\char`\"{}.

{\bfseries Note}\+: prior to 1.\+0.\+x, several of these functions took a {\ttfamily strict} parameter. This has since been removed from the A\+PI as it was no longer necessary.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily parse\+Date(string)}}

Parse a cookie date string into a {\ttfamily Date}. Parses according to R\+F\+C6265 Section 5.\+1.\+1, not {\ttfamily Date.\+parse()}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily format\+Date(date)}}

Format a Date into a R\+F\+C1123 string (the R\+F\+C6265-\/recommended format).

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily canonical\+Domain(str)}}

Transforms a domain-\/name into a canonical domain-\/name. The canonical domain-\/name is a trimmed, lowercased, stripped-\/of-\/leading-\/dot and optionally punycode-\/encoded domain-\/name (Section 5.\+1.\+2 of R\+F\+C6265). For the most part, this function is idempotent (can be run again on its output without ill effects).

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily domain\+Match(str,dom\+Str\mbox{[},canonicalize=true\mbox{]})}}

Answers \char`\"{}does this real domain match the domain in a cookie?\char`\"{}. The {\ttfamily str} is the \char`\"{}current\char`\"{} domain-\/name and the {\ttfamily dom\+Str} is the \char`\"{}cookie\char`\"{} domain-\/name. Matches according to R\+F\+C6265 Section 5.\+1.\+3, but it helps to think of it as a \char`\"{}suffix match\char`\"{}.

The {\ttfamily canonicalize} parameter will run the other two parameters through {\ttfamily canonical\+Domain} or not.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily default\+Path(path)}}

Given a current request/response path, gives the Path apropriate for storing in a cookie. This is basically the \char`\"{}directory\char`\"{} of a \char`\"{}file\char`\"{} in the path, but is specified by Section 5.\+1.\+4 of the R\+FC.

The {\ttfamily path} parameter M\+U\+ST be {\itshape only} the pathname part of a U\+RI (i.\+e. excludes the hostname, query, fragment, etc.). This is the {\ttfamily .pathname} property of node\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily uri.\+parse()} output.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily path\+Match(req\+Path,cookie\+Path)}}

Answers \char`\"{}does the request-\/path path-\/match a given cookie-\/path?\char`\"{} as per R\+F\+C6265 Section 5.\+1.\+4. Returns a boolean.

This is essentially a prefix-\/match where {\ttfamily cookie\+Path} is a prefix of {\ttfamily req\+Path}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily parse(cookie\+String\mbox{[}, options\mbox{]})}}

alias for {\ttfamily Cookie.\+parse(cookie\+String\mbox{[}, options\mbox{]})}

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily from\+J\+S\+O\+N(string)}}

alias for {\ttfamily Cookie.\+from\+J\+S\+O\+N(string)}

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily get\+Public\+Suffix(hostname)}}

Returns the public suffix of this hostname. The public suffix is the shortest domain-\/name upon which a cookie can be set. Returns {\ttfamily null} if the hostname cannot have cookies set for it.

For example\+: {\ttfamily www.\+example.\+com} and {\ttfamily www.\+subdomain.\+example.\+com} both have public suffix {\ttfamily example.\+com}.

For further information, see \href{http://publicsuffix.org/}{\tt http\+://publicsuffix.\+org/}. This module derives its list from that site. This call is currently a wrapper around \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/psl}{\tt {\ttfamily psl}}\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/psl#pslgetdomain}{\tt get() method}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily cookie\+Compare(a,b)}}

For use with {\ttfamily .sort()}, sorts a list of cookies into the recommended order given in the R\+FC (Section 5.\+4 step 2). The sort algorithm is, in order of precedence\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Longest {\ttfamily .path}
\item oldest {\ttfamily .creation} (which has a 1ms precision, same as {\ttfamily Date})
\item lowest {\ttfamily .creation\+Index} (to get beyond the 1ms precision)
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var cookies = [ /* unsorted array of Cookie objects */ ];
cookies = cookies.sort(cookieCompare);
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries Note}\+: Since Java\+Script\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Date} is limited to a 1ms precision, cookies within the same milisecond are entirely possible. This is especially true when using the {\ttfamily now} option to {\ttfamily .set\+Cookie()}. The {\ttfamily .creation\+Index} property is a per-\/process global counter, assigned during construction with {\ttfamily new Cookie()}. This preserves the spirit of the R\+FC sorting\+: older cookies go first. This works great for {\ttfamily Memory\+Cookie\+Store}, since {\ttfamily Set-\/\+Cookie} headers are parsed in order, but may not be so great for distributed systems. Sophisticated {\ttfamily Store}s may wish to set this to some other {\itshape logical clock} such that if cookies A and B are created in the same millisecond, but cookie A is created before cookie B, then {\ttfamily A.\+creation\+Index $<$ B.\+creation\+Index}. If you want to alter the global counter, which you probably {\itshape shouldn\textquotesingle{}t} do, it\textquotesingle{}s stored in {\ttfamily Cookie.\+cookies\+Created}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily permute\+Domain(domain)}}

Generates a list of all possible domains that {\ttfamily domain\+Match()} the parameter. May be handy for implementing cookie stores.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily permute\+Path(path)}}

Generates a list of all possible paths that {\ttfamily path\+Match()} the parameter. May be handy for implementing cookie stores.

\subsection*{Cookie}

Exported via {\ttfamily tough.\+Cookie}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily Cookie.\+parse(cookie\+String\mbox{[}, options\mbox{]})}}

Parses a single Cookie or Set-\/\+Cookie H\+T\+TP header into a {\ttfamily Cookie} object. Returns {\ttfamily undefined} if the string can\textquotesingle{}t be parsed.

The options parameter is not required and currently has only one property\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape loose} -\/ boolean -\/ if {\ttfamily true} enable parsing of key-\/less cookies like {\ttfamily =abc} and {\ttfamily =}, which are not R\+F\+C-\/compliant.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If options is not an object, it is ignored, which means you can use {\ttfamily Array\+::map} with it.

Here\textquotesingle{}s how to process the Set-\/\+Cookie header(s) on a node H\+T\+T\+P/\+H\+T\+T\+PS response\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
if (res.headers['set-cookie'] instanceof Array)
  cookies = res.headers['set-cookie'].map(Cookie.parse);
else
  cookies = [Cookie.parse(res.headers['set-cookie'])];
\end{DoxyCode}


{\itshape Note\+:} in version 2.\+3.\+3, tough-\/cookie limited the number of spaces before the {\ttfamily =} to 256 characters. This limitation has since been removed. See \href{https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/92}{\tt Issue 92}

\subsubsection*{Properties}

Cookie object properties\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape key} -\/ string -\/ the name or key of the cookie (default \char`\"{}\char`\"{})
\item {\itshape value} -\/ string -\/ the value of the cookie (default \char`\"{}\char`\"{})
\item {\itshape expires} -\/ {\ttfamily Date} -\/ if set, the {\ttfamily Expires=} attribute of the cookie (defaults to the string {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+Infinity\char`\"{}}). See {\ttfamily set\+Expires()}
\item {\itshape max\+Age} -\/ seconds -\/ if set, the {\ttfamily Max-\/\+Age=} attribute {\itshape in seconds} of the cookie. May also be set to strings {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+Infinity\char`\"{}} and {\ttfamily \char`\"{}-\/\+Infinity\char`\"{}} for non-\/expiry and immediate-\/expiry, respectively. See {\ttfamily set\+Max\+Age()}
\item {\itshape domain} -\/ string -\/ the {\ttfamily Domain=} attribute of the cookie
\item {\itshape path} -\/ string -\/ the {\ttfamily Path=} of the cookie
\item {\itshape secure} -\/ boolean -\/ the {\ttfamily Secure} cookie flag
\item {\itshape http\+Only} -\/ boolean -\/ the {\ttfamily Http\+Only} cookie flag
\item {\itshape extensions} -\/ {\ttfamily Array} -\/ any unrecognized cookie attributes as strings (even if equal-\/signs inside)
\item {\itshape creation} -\/ {\ttfamily Date} -\/ when this cookie was constructed
\item {\itshape creation\+Index} -\/ number -\/ set at construction, used to provide greater sort precision (please see {\ttfamily cookie\+Compare(a,b)} for a full explanation)
\end{DoxyItemize}

After a cookie has been passed through {\ttfamily Cookie\+Jar.\+set\+Cookie()} it will have the following additional attributes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape host\+Only} -\/ boolean -\/ is this a host-\/only cookie (i.\+e. no Domain field was set, but was instead implied)
\item {\itshape path\+Is\+Default} -\/ boolean -\/ if true, there was no Path field on the cookie and {\ttfamily default\+Path()} was used to derive one.
\item {\itshape creation} -\/ {\ttfamily Date} -\/ {\bfseries modified} from construction to when the cookie was added to the jar
\item {\itshape last\+Accessed} -\/ {\ttfamily Date} -\/ last time the cookie got accessed. Will affect cookie cleaning once implemented. Using {\ttfamily cookiejar.\+get\+Cookies(...)} will update this attribute.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily Cookie(\mbox{[}\{properties\}\mbox{]})}}

Receives an options object that can contain any of the above Cookie properties, uses the default for unspecified properties.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .to\+String()}}

encode to a Set-\/\+Cookie header value. The Expires cookie field is set using {\ttfamily format\+Date()}, but is omitted entirely if {\ttfamily .expires} is {\ttfamily Infinity}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .cookie\+String()}}

encode to a Cookie header value (i.\+e. the {\ttfamily .key} and {\ttfamily .value} properties joined with \textquotesingle{}=\textquotesingle{}).

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .set\+Expires(\+String)}}

sets the expiry based on a date-\/string passed through {\ttfamily parse\+Date()}. If parse\+Date returns {\ttfamily null} (i.\+e. can\textquotesingle{}t parse this date string), {\ttfamily .expires} is set to {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+Infinity\char`\"{}} (a string) is set.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .set\+Max\+Age(number)}}

sets the max\+Age in seconds. Coerces {\ttfamily -\/\+Infinity} to {\ttfamily \char`\"{}-\/\+Infinity\char`\"{}} and {\ttfamily Infinity} to {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+Infinity\char`\"{}} so it J\+S\+ON serializes correctly.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .expiry\+Time(\mbox{[}now=Date.\+now()\mbox{]})}}

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .expiry\+Date(\mbox{[}now=Date.\+now()\mbox{]})}}

expiry\+Time() Computes the absolute unix-\/epoch milliseconds that this cookie expires. expiry\+Date() works similarly, except it returns a {\ttfamily Date} object. Note that in both cases the {\ttfamily now} parameter should be milliseconds.

Max-\/\+Age takes precedence over Expires (as per the R\+FC). The {\ttfamily .creation} attribute -- or, by default, the {\ttfamily now} parameter -- is used to offset the {\ttfamily .max\+Age} attribute.

If Expires ({\ttfamily .expires}) is set, that\textquotesingle{}s returned.

Otherwise, {\ttfamily expiry\+Time()} returns {\ttfamily Infinity} and {\ttfamily expiry\+Date()} returns a {\ttfamily Date} object for \char`\"{}\+Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03\+:14\+:07 G\+M\+T\char`\"{} (latest date that can be expressed by a 32-\/bit {\ttfamily time\+\_\+t}; the common limit for most user-\/agents).

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .T\+TL(\mbox{[}now=Date.\+now()\mbox{]})}}

compute the T\+TL relative to {\ttfamily now} (milliseconds). The same precedence rules as for {\ttfamily expiry\+Time}/{\ttfamily expiry\+Date} apply.

The \char`\"{}number\char`\"{} {\ttfamily Infinity} is returned for cookies without an explicit expiry and {\ttfamily 0} is returned if the cookie is expired. Otherwise a time-\/to-\/live in milliseconds is returned.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .canonicalized\+Doman()}}

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .cdomain()}}

return the canonicalized {\ttfamily .domain} field. This is lower-\/cased and punycode (R\+F\+C3490) encoded if the domain has any non-\/\+A\+S\+C\+II characters.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .to\+J\+S\+O\+N()}}

For convenience in using {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N.\+serialize(cookie)}. Returns a plain-\/old {\ttfamily Object} that can be J\+S\+O\+N-\/serialized.

Any {\ttfamily Date} properties (i.\+e., {\ttfamily .expires}, {\ttfamily .creation}, and {\ttfamily .last\+Accessed}) are exported in I\+SO format ({\ttfamily .to\+I\+S\+O\+String()}).

{\bfseries N\+O\+TE}\+: Custom {\ttfamily Cookie} properties will be discarded. In tough-\/cookie 1.\+x, since there was no {\ttfamily .to\+J\+S\+ON} method explicitly defined, all enumerable properties were captured. If you want a property to be serialized, add the property name to the {\ttfamily Cookie.\+serializable\+Properties} Array.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily Cookie.\+from\+J\+S\+O\+N(str\+Or\+Obj)}}

Does the reverse of {\ttfamily cookie.\+to\+J\+S\+O\+N()}. If passed a string, will {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N.\+parse()} that first.

Any {\ttfamily Date} properties (i.\+e., {\ttfamily .expires}, {\ttfamily .creation}, and {\ttfamily .last\+Accessed}) are parsed via {\ttfamily Date.\+parse()}, not the tough-\/cookie {\ttfamily parse\+Date}, since it\textquotesingle{}s Java\+Script/\+J\+S\+O\+N-\/y timestamps being handled at this layer.

Returns {\ttfamily null} upon J\+S\+ON parsing error.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .clone()}}

Does a deep clone of this cookie, exactly implemented as {\ttfamily Cookie.\+from\+J\+S\+ON(cookie.\+to\+J\+S\+O\+N())}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .validate()}}

Status\+: {\itshape IN P\+R\+O\+G\+R\+E\+SS}. Works for a few things, but is by no means comprehensive.

validates cookie attributes for semantic correctness. Useful for \char`\"{}lint\char`\"{} checking any Set-\/\+Cookie headers you generate. For now, it returns a boolean, but eventually could return a reason string -- you can future-\/proof with this construct\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
if (cookie.validate() === true) \{
  // it's tasty
\} else \{
  // yuck!
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Cookie\+Jar}

Exported via {\ttfamily tough.\+Cookie\+Jar}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily Cookie\+Jar(\mbox{[}store\mbox{]},\mbox{[}options\mbox{]})}}

Simply use {\ttfamily new Cookie\+Jar()}. If you\textquotesingle{}d like to use a custom store, pass that to the constructor otherwise a {\ttfamily Memory\+Cookie\+Store} will be created and used.

The {\ttfamily options} object can be omitted and can have the following properties\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape reject\+Public\+Suffixes} -\/ boolean -\/ default {\ttfamily true} -\/ reject cookies with domains like \char`\"{}com\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}co.\+uk\char`\"{}
\item {\itshape loose\+Mode} -\/ boolean -\/ default {\ttfamily false} -\/ accept malformed cookies like {\ttfamily bar} and {\ttfamily =bar}, which have an implied empty name. This is not in the standard, but is used sometimes on the web and is accepted by (most) browsers.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Since eventually this module would like to support database/remote/etc. Cookie\+Jars, continuation passing style is used for Cookie\+Jar methods.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .set\+Cookie(cookie\+Or\+String, current\+Url, \mbox{[}\{options\},\mbox{]} cb(err,cookie))}}

Attempt to set the cookie in the cookie jar. If the operation fails, an error will be given to the callback {\ttfamily cb}, otherwise the cookie is passed through. The cookie will have updated {\ttfamily .creation}, {\ttfamily .last\+Accessed} and {\ttfamily .host\+Only} properties.

The {\ttfamily options} object can be omitted and can have the following properties\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape http} -\/ boolean -\/ default {\ttfamily true} -\/ indicates if this is an H\+T\+TP or non-\/\+H\+T\+TP A\+PI. Affects Http\+Only cookies.
\item {\itshape secure} -\/ boolean -\/ autodetect from url -\/ indicates if this is a \char`\"{}\+Secure\char`\"{} A\+PI. If the current\+Url starts with {\ttfamily https\+:} or {\ttfamily wss\+:} then this is defaulted to {\ttfamily true}, otherwise {\ttfamily false}.
\item {\itshape now} -\/ Date -\/ default {\ttfamily new Date()} -\/ what to use for the creation/access time of cookies
\item {\itshape ignore\+Error} -\/ boolean -\/ default {\ttfamily false} -\/ silently ignore things like parse errors and invalid domains. {\ttfamily Store} errors aren\textquotesingle{}t ignored by this option.
\end{DoxyItemize}

As per the R\+FC, the {\ttfamily .host\+Only} property is set if there was no \char`\"{}\+Domain=\char`\"{} parameter in the cookie string (or {\ttfamily .domain} was null on the Cookie object). The {\ttfamily .domain} property is set to the fully-\/qualified hostname of {\ttfamily current\+Url} in this case. Matching this cookie requires an exact hostname match (not a {\ttfamily domain\+Match} as per usual).

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .set\+Cookie\+Sync(cookie\+Or\+String, current\+Url, \mbox{[}\{options\}\mbox{]})}}

Synchronous version of {\ttfamily set\+Cookie}; only works with synchronous stores (e.\+g. the default {\ttfamily Memory\+Cookie\+Store}).

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .get\+Cookies(current\+Url, \mbox{[}\{options\},\mbox{]} cb(err,cookies))}}

Retrieve the list of cookies that can be sent in a Cookie header for the current url.

If an error is encountered, that\textquotesingle{}s passed as {\ttfamily err} to the callback, otherwise an {\ttfamily Array} of {\ttfamily Cookie} objects is passed. The array is sorted with {\ttfamily cookie\+Compare()} unless the {\ttfamily \{sort\+:false\}} option is given.

The {\ttfamily options} object can be omitted and can have the following properties\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape http} -\/ boolean -\/ default {\ttfamily true} -\/ indicates if this is an H\+T\+TP or non-\/\+H\+T\+TP A\+PI. Affects Http\+Only cookies.
\item {\itshape secure} -\/ boolean -\/ autodetect from url -\/ indicates if this is a \char`\"{}\+Secure\char`\"{} A\+PI. If the current\+Url starts with {\ttfamily https\+:} or {\ttfamily wss\+:} then this is defaulted to {\ttfamily true}, otherwise {\ttfamily false}.
\item {\itshape now} -\/ Date -\/ default {\ttfamily new Date()} -\/ what to use for the creation/access time of cookies
\item {\itshape expire} -\/ boolean -\/ default {\ttfamily true} -\/ perform expiry-\/time checking of cookies and asynchronously remove expired cookies from the store. Using {\ttfamily false} will return expired cookies and {\bfseries not} remove them from the store (which is useful for replaying Set-\/\+Cookie headers, potentially).
\item {\itshape all\+Paths} -\/ boolean -\/ default {\ttfamily false} -\/ if {\ttfamily true}, do not scope cookies by path. The default uses R\+F\+C-\/compliant path scoping. {\bfseries Note}\+: may not be supported by the underlying store (the default {\ttfamily Memory\+Cookie\+Store} supports it).
\end{DoxyItemize}

The {\ttfamily .last\+Accessed} property of the returned cookies will have been updated.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .get\+Cookies\+Sync(current\+Url, \mbox{[}\{options\}\mbox{]})}}

Synchronous version of {\ttfamily get\+Cookies}; only works with synchronous stores (e.\+g. the default {\ttfamily Memory\+Cookie\+Store}).

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .get\+Cookie\+String(...)}}

Accepts the same options as {\ttfamily .get\+Cookies()} but passes a string suitable for a Cookie header rather than an array to the callback. Simply maps the {\ttfamily Cookie} array via {\ttfamily .cookie\+String()}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .get\+Cookie\+String\+Sync(...)}}

Synchronous version of {\ttfamily get\+Cookie\+String}; only works with synchronous stores (e.\+g. the default {\ttfamily Memory\+Cookie\+Store}).

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .get\+Set\+Cookie\+Strings(...)}}

Returns an array of strings suitable for {\bfseries Set-\/\+Cookie} headers. Accepts the same options as {\ttfamily .get\+Cookies()}. Simply maps the cookie array via {\ttfamily .to\+String()}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .get\+Set\+Cookie\+Strings\+Sync(...)}}

Synchronous version of {\ttfamily get\+Set\+Cookie\+Strings}; only works with synchronous stores (e.\+g. the default {\ttfamily Memory\+Cookie\+Store}).

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .serialize(cb(err,serialized\+Object))}}

Serialize the Jar if the underlying store supports {\ttfamily .get\+All\+Cookies}.

{\bfseries N\+O\+TE}\+: Custom {\ttfamily Cookie} properties will be discarded. If you want a property to be serialized, add the property name to the {\ttfamily Cookie.\+serializable\+Properties} Array.

See \mbox{[}Serialization Format\mbox{]}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .serialize\+Sync()}}

Sync version of .serialize

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .to\+J\+S\+O\+N()}}

Alias of .serialize\+Sync() for the convenience of {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N.\+stringify(cookiejar)}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily Cookie\+Jar.\+deserialize(serialized, \mbox{[}store\mbox{]}, cb(err,object))}}

A new Jar is created and the serialized Cookies are added to the underlying store. Each {\ttfamily Cookie} is added via {\ttfamily store.\+put\+Cookie} in the order in which they appear in the serialization.

The {\ttfamily store} argument is optional, but should be an instance of {\ttfamily Store}. By default, a new instance of {\ttfamily Memory\+Cookie\+Store} is created.

As a convenience, if {\ttfamily serialized} is a string, it is passed through {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N.\+parse} first. If that throws an error, this is passed to the callback.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily Cookie\+Jar.\+deserialize\+Sync(serialized, \mbox{[}store\mbox{]})}}

Sync version of {\ttfamily .deserialize}. {\itshape Note} that the {\ttfamily store} must be synchronous for this to work.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily Cookie\+Jar.\+from\+J\+S\+O\+N(string)}}

Alias of {\ttfamily .deserialize\+Sync} to provide consistency with {\ttfamily Cookie.\+from\+J\+S\+O\+N()}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .clone(\mbox{[}store,\mbox{]}cb(err,new\+Jar))}}

Produces a deep clone of this jar. Modifications to the original won\textquotesingle{}t affect the clone, and vice versa.

The {\ttfamily store} argument is optional, but should be an instance of {\ttfamily Store}. By default, a new instance of {\ttfamily Memory\+Cookie\+Store} is created. Transferring between store types is supported so long as the source implements {\ttfamily .get\+All\+Cookies()} and the destination implements {\ttfamily .put\+Cookie()}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily .clone\+Sync(\mbox{[}store\mbox{]})}}

Synchronous version of {\ttfamily .clone}, returning a new {\ttfamily Cookie\+Jar} instance.

The {\ttfamily store} argument is optional, but must be a {\itshape synchronous} {\ttfamily Store} instance if specified. If not passed, a new instance of {\ttfamily Memory\+Cookie\+Store} is used.

The {\itshape source} and {\itshape destination} must both be synchronous {\ttfamily Store}s. If one or both stores are asynchronous, use {\ttfamily .clone} instead. Recall that {\ttfamily Memory\+Cookie\+Store} supports both synchronous and asynchronous A\+PI calls.

\subsection*{Store}

Base class for Cookie\+Jar stores. Available as {\ttfamily tough.\+Store}.

\subsection*{Store A\+PI}

The storage model for each {\ttfamily Cookie\+Jar} instance can be replaced with a custom implementation. The default is {\ttfamily Memory\+Cookie\+Store} which can be found in the {\ttfamily lib/memstore.\+js} file. The A\+PI uses continuation-\/passing-\/style to allow for asynchronous stores.

Stores should inherit from the base {\ttfamily Store} class, which is available as `require(\textquotesingle{}tough-\/cookie').Store\`{}.

Stores are asynchronous by default, but if {\ttfamily store.\+synchronous} is set to {\ttfamily true}, then the {\ttfamily $\ast$\+Sync} methods on the of the containing {\ttfamily Cookie\+Jar} can be used (however, the continuation-\/passing style

All {\ttfamily domain} parameters will have been normalized before calling.

The Cookie store must have all of the following methods.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily store.\+find\+Cookie(domain, path, key, cb(err,cookie))}}

Retrieve a cookie with the given domain, path and key (a.\+k.\+a. name). The R\+FC maintains that exactly one of these cookies should exist in a store. If the store is using versioning, this means that the latest/newest such cookie should be returned.

Callback takes an error and the resulting {\ttfamily Cookie} object. If no cookie is found then {\ttfamily null} M\+U\+ST be passed instead (i.\+e. not an error).

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily store.\+find\+Cookies(domain, path, cb(err,cookies))}}

Locates cookies matching the given domain and path. This is most often called in the context of {\ttfamily cookiejar.\+get\+Cookies()} above.

If no cookies are found, the callback M\+U\+ST be passed an empty array.

The resulting list will be checked for applicability to the current request according to the R\+FC (domain-\/match, path-\/match, http-\/only-\/flag, secure-\/flag, expiry, etc.), so it\textquotesingle{}s OK to use an optimistic search algorithm when implementing this method. However, the search algorithm used S\+H\+O\+U\+LD try to find cookies that {\ttfamily domain\+Match()} the domain and {\ttfamily path\+Match()} the path in order to limit the amount of checking that needs to be done.

As of version 0.\+9.\+12, the {\ttfamily all\+Paths} option to {\ttfamily cookiejar.\+get\+Cookies()} above will cause the path here to be {\ttfamily null}. If the path is {\ttfamily null}, path-\/matching M\+U\+ST N\+OT be performed (i.\+e. domain-\/matching only).

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily store.\+put\+Cookie(cookie, cb(err))}}

Adds a new cookie to the store. The implementation S\+H\+O\+U\+LD replace any existing cookie with the same {\ttfamily .domain}, {\ttfamily .path}, and {\ttfamily .key} properties -- depending on the nature of the implementation, it\textquotesingle{}s possible that between the call to {\ttfamily fetch\+Cookie} and {\ttfamily put\+Cookie} that a duplicate {\ttfamily put\+Cookie} can occur.

The {\ttfamily cookie} object M\+U\+ST N\+OT be modified; the caller will have already updated the {\ttfamily .creation} and {\ttfamily .last\+Accessed} properties.

Pass an error if the cookie cannot be stored.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily store.\+update\+Cookie(old\+Cookie, new\+Cookie, cb(err))}}

Update an existing cookie. The implementation M\+U\+ST update the {\ttfamily .value} for a cookie with the same {\ttfamily domain}, {\ttfamily .path} and {\ttfamily .key}. The implementation S\+H\+O\+U\+LD check that the old value in the store is equivalent to {\ttfamily old\+Cookie} -\/ how the conflict is resolved is up to the store.

The {\ttfamily .last\+Accessed} property will always be different between the two objects (to the precision possible via Java\+Script\textquotesingle{}s clock). Both {\ttfamily .creation} and {\ttfamily .creation\+Index} are guaranteed to be the same. Stores M\+AY ignore or defer the {\ttfamily .last\+Accessed} change at the cost of affecting how cookies are selected for automatic deletion (e.\+g., least-\/recently-\/used, which is up to the store to implement).

Stores may wish to optimize changing the {\ttfamily .value} of the cookie in the store versus storing a new cookie. If the implementation doesn\textquotesingle{}t define this method a stub that calls {\ttfamily put\+Cookie(new\+Cookie,cb)} will be added to the store object.

The {\ttfamily new\+Cookie} and {\ttfamily old\+Cookie} objects M\+U\+ST N\+OT be modified.

Pass an error if the new\+Cookie cannot be stored.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily store.\+remove\+Cookie(domain, path, key, cb(err))}}

Remove a cookie from the store (see notes on {\ttfamily find\+Cookie} about the uniqueness constraint).

The implementation M\+U\+ST N\+OT pass an error if the cookie doesn\textquotesingle{}t exist; only pass an error due to the failure to remove an existing cookie.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily store.\+remove\+Cookies(domain, path, cb(err))}}

Removes matching cookies from the store. The {\ttfamily path} parameter is optional, and if missing means all paths in a domain should be removed.

Pass an error O\+N\+LY if removing any existing cookies failed.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily store.\+get\+All\+Cookies(cb(err, cookies))}}

Produces an {\ttfamily Array} of all cookies during {\ttfamily jar.\+serialize()}. The items in the array can be true {\ttfamily Cookie} objects or generic {\ttfamily Object}s with the \mbox{[}Serialization Format\mbox{]} data structure.

Cookies S\+H\+O\+U\+LD be returned in creation order to preserve sorting via {\ttfamily compare\+Cookies()}. For reference, {\ttfamily Memory\+Cookie\+Store} will sort by {\ttfamily .creation\+Index} since it uses true {\ttfamily Cookie} objects internally. If you don\textquotesingle{}t return the cookies in creation order, they\textquotesingle{}ll still be sorted by creation time, but this only has a precision of 1ms. See {\ttfamily compare\+Cookies} for more detail.

Pass an error if retrieval fails.

\subsection*{Memory\+Cookie\+Store}

Inherits from {\ttfamily Store}.

A just-\/in-\/memory Cookie\+Jar synchronous store implementation, used by default. Despite being a synchronous implementation, it\textquotesingle{}s usable with both the synchronous and asynchronous forms of the {\ttfamily Cookie\+Jar} A\+PI.

\subsection*{Community Cookie Stores}

These are some Store implementations authored and maintained by the community. They aren\textquotesingle{}t official and we don\textquotesingle{}t vouch for them but you may be interested to have a look\+:

\section*{Serialization Format}

{\bfseries N\+O\+TE}\+: if you want to have custom {\ttfamily Cookie} properties serialized, add the property name to {\ttfamily Cookie.\+serializable\+Properties}.


\begin{DoxyCode}
\{
  // The version of tough-cookie that serialized this jar.
  version: 'tough-cookie@1.x.y',

  // add the store type, to make humans happy:
  storeType: 'MemoryCookieStore',

  // CookieJar configuration:
  rejectPublicSuffixes: true,
  // ... future items go here

  // Gets filled from jar.store.getAllCookies():
  cookies: [
    \{
      key: 'string',
      value: 'string',
      // ...
      /* other Cookie.serializableProperties go here */
    \}
  ]
\}
